## Bilocation


When you take out the charge and polarity and become sacred neutral it is cocreating reality. Manifesting your reality . Building the muscles and belief that it’s not for instant gratification. Through creating imagery and vision and feeling you can create other yous that are physically manifest versions of yourself. To be present in that other reality organically happens with the expansion of the muscle in the third eye. Basic form is through imagery. Perceived if you believe in it. Physically manifest in each location. Sometimes aware of it sometimes not if it becomes an overload and not required. Making a choice not to be instantly gratified in what other selves are doing.
We have built inside a dreaming body. When we reach a certain frequency of creation and co creation you trigger the bilocation process and the dreaming body immediately becomes a part of you as if you were in a dreaming frequency without the sleep paralysis attached to it. Once you raise to a certain frequency the I ams agenda has more revelations behind it to allow it more access to conscious awareness . Has to be in your own bubble of reality so as not to tread on another’s journey.
Second stage is full on simultaneous awareness of the second you. A realisation that the second you is still a singularity in a dream world, so you can be a quadality ( see quadality)
