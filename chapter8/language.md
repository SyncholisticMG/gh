## Language

The DNA instrument of experience uses consciousness to convert light into sound to create memories.
We perceive,
receive,
interpret,
store,
and express ourselves in words as codes,
multidimensional patterns we call language.


We may know multiple languages,
speak in one language but process and think in another until we become fluent.
A skilled linguist can speak seven or eight languages and easily switch between them.
Language is a form of communication,
consciousness being expressed verbally,
emotionally,
and physically.
The written word is light information stored in ink.
It may take hundreds of thousands of years for the data to be perceived as light again.
Language is a choice beyond cognition.
It is the currency
&mdash;
a current energy voltage going through us.
It is a medium to express ourselves.
Sometimes there are many currents going back and forth,
an opera,
for example,
singing and dancing to accentuate,
punctuate,
and make the language more robust.


We think in perfect sentences.
Nobody remembers learning to speak their first language,
their mother tongue.
We struggled to find the perfect sentence,
but it all made sense in our head.
The light that is the pureness of our consciousness knows what it's trying to say,
and it translates from light to sound.
Syntax and sense can be independent of each other
&mdash;
*colorless green ideas sleep furiously*.
It doesn’t have to make sense to feel good.
A word is not a creation.
A sound is.
The light can be modified with intonation to create more light.
Martin Luther King said,
*I have a dream*.
Out of context it's superfluous.
In the context of a unified world it allows the actual intonation process to create flashes of light.
They create more flashes of light.
We can create light with our speech.


Grammar is sentences flowing together to create a sensation,
the breaking up and assembling of the words,
the nouns,
the pronouns so we understand the mathematics of creating a sentence in English at that particular time.
That alone does not make you a good talker or writer.
You still have to be able to authentically emanate the words.
It's more like the nature of teaching.

Language is spacial awareness.
Grammar and syntax are the way consciousness adds intuitive wisdom to the statements themselves.
It adds more to the code.
When you look at words as sound wave forms we can see patterns like DNA intertwinement.
We exchange DNA light at a higher perspective level.
DNA changes through the observation,
the interaction between different types of consciousness.
Everyone allows a different layer of change.
Words are powerful.
Incantations are words.
Prayers are words.
Mantras are sounds.
Certain phrases can put a shock into a person’s system.
Words can place us on the path of understanding or cast us out to outer darkness.


Mythology is the potency of language memorialized.
All the ancient myths were oral.
The storytelling was the entire bureaucracy of the tribe,
preserved and performed by shamans with the full authenticity of their voices.
Joseph Campbell unpacked these myths to form vast maps of the unconscious.
He distilled them all down to the hero,
the central myth of all cultures.
The hero is a light bringer.
The light is a new knowledge.
The bringer of fire,
the means to reproduce fire at will,
was a hero in his time.
They told stories about him for generations.
Fire was a big deal.
The story of the fire starter literally carried his light forward for generations as people huddled around fires at night.
Language has its own consciousness.
Children are in a learning state as they grow.
They are exploring words,
places,
positions.
They have focus and a strategy as they understand placement,
position,
and timing.
If we hit an annunciation perfectly it creates a euphoric feeling within us.
There's an actual dopamine journey behind owning that fluent form.
Where there are no barriers,
the language becomes the instinct and pattern recognition.
A child is listening long before they are speaking.



There are subsections within language.
A thought in a conversation is fluid.
We don’t know what we're going to say next,
but we have intention when we continue a conversation.
It maintains a conscious state of focus to continuously translate light into sound.
It creates a lasting memory so we can understand the nature of our conversation.
Thoughts can be stimulated by words.

A new language is a mathematical journey of structure.
Mastering the body’s annunciation and conjugation journey by using intonation,
the starting and stopping of the nasal process.
There is a mathematical formula to mastering the tongue,
nose,
throat,
and lips,
and how the innate body language of each language affects the intonation journey.
It is an understanding of how fluent energy works together with all those pieces and parts.
The inhalation of air from the lungs,
the trachea,
the larynx,
the vocal cords,
the force of the tongue,
the nose manipulating the sounds to make intonation resonance with the lung.
Certain words resonate from the lungs to the nose.
The subtleties on how the wind form the lungs is being used is intricate to the language.
All of those mechanics make learning a new language difficult.


The tongue is the second organ that gets created.
The heart is first.
The tongue takes the vibration direct from the heart and sends it to the tip of the tongue so the heart's vibration is the base of our language.
The tongue emanates an energy that we perceive in light,
The position and placement of the tongue and teeth creates a piezoelectric effect on the teeth,
producing an electromagnetic effect in the body as an unseen energy of expression.
The roof of our mouths has three plates that determine how chi is spread through our bodies.
If they are tight,
with a sunken nasal passage,
there's an occupying presence taking away from the greater us to express.
The sinus along with those three plates creates a vibration that is our expression.
The tongue works like Morse code,
tapping and creating electromagnetic signals the brain receives as language.
The heart sends the language through the tongue.
The brain receives it.


There are conversations in which we go beyond the five senses,
into a holographic perception of the language suspended in our consciousness while we are process it.
Some people process faster than others.
Slow processors understand the subject matter better in the long run.
They don’t allow themselves to be overwhelmed by the data,
or over-process,
and they don't miss nuances.

Humans are analog speakers trying to achieve a dual process.
We are analog and digital thinkers.
Off-world species no longer operate in binary coding.
They think from multiple perspectives.
It allows them a greater understanding of the unlimited point of view.
They are waiting for us to come out of the limitation our language imposes on us.
The global narrative blocks language from evolving into multidimensional thinking.





The entire body gets involved in communicating.
Words make up the least significant part of our rapport,
less than ten percent.
The rest is expressed through our tone,
tempo,
timber,
volume,
and physiology,
as in posture,
gesture,
breathing,
facial expressions,
and blinking.
We often use hand positions when explaining dense material,
using the streams of light in our hands to examine the field and the strands we want to connect with.
It is like moving the sheets of information around to get to the specific data faster,
a way of determining sub information and how that effects the whole.
It is almost like I am using the hands to complete a spiritual process.


When we speak light language it's through the throat chakra.
All of our senses observe the vocal patterns the reality is observing through the throat chakra.
The knowing is in the heart.
The completeness of the manifestation is in the voice
&mdash;
the throat chakra.
We are setting a tone and frequency.
People might not speak a language but they can still intuit a body language,
an auric field interacting with it,
and the psychic information which is the sign form of light language.
Speaking light language uses all parts of our body.
The final manifestation is how the reality interprets it as an observer or an unentangled observer.
Light language can speak to unentangled observers and be unentangled,
yet they still get their point across.
We have the right to speak with them.
The *I am* presence is the apex of this hierarchical order.
We can use our words of command to be in dominion or communion with beings.
When our light bodies are calibrating more with the *I am* presence,
languages through our soul and voice box becomes easier.
The translation is free flowing with harmony in which several phrases before you speak light language can get changed and modified,
the expression of photonic light.
We are giving codes to light itself to change an expression,
like a kaleidoscope opening and closing a specific pattern.
We can make multiple sets and patterns throughout the entire conversation.
It's almost like we remember how to use the frequencies of the voice intonations to effect reality.
