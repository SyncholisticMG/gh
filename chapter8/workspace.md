The entire body gets involved in communicating.
Words make up the least significant part of our rapport,
less than ten percent.
The rest is expressed through our tone,
tempo,
timber,
volume,
and physiology,
as in posture,
gesture,
breathing,
facial expressions,
and blinking.
We often use hand positions when explaining dense material,
using the streams of light in our hands to examine the field and the strands we want to connect with.
It is like moving the sheets of information around to get to the specific data faster,
a way of determining sub information and how that effects the whole.
It is almost like I am using the hands to complete a spiritual process.

Q: How are we using our eyes and 3rd eye to communicate?
We are usually accessing information through our eyes.
The more we observe ourselves on recordings we can get a better understanding of how the body positions itself naturally to give certain experiences.
In the eye generation journey your 3rd eye is the projector and your mind is the receiver of data allowing you to generate thought constructs from the hologram.
Remember the SUN JOURNEY MEDITATION where the two eyes activate the 3rd eye.
The position of the eyes activates the 3rd eye.
The 3rd eye then grabs information out of the field which you can sense omnidirectionally around you.
The instrument of experience grabs it from a position in space time.
Some people have difficulties to connect through eye contact.
They have a stare or look away pattern that indicates that they are not really in the body or ready to leave any moment.
A glazed look can also be very positive as in changing the resonance frequency to find matched information.
Deep simultaneous gaze & glace can be a searching for a message back in time for the person that will be a signature frequency match for them going forward into the future into a branch of time in which the information mentioned has been stored in memory long enough to create a change.
On the negative side it can also mean we are denying matches and reflecting them back out.
Haunted people cannot hold a gaze which is quite common.
When people are in love and are looking into each other’s eyes their pupils dilate through their auric energy.
This helps them to gain an independent appreciation for their energy as the eyes dilate to take in more light and create a denser energy.
That would be situation where you find yourself at the edge of leaving the chemical memory state.
The position of the corneas in the eye sockets determine what the eyes can perceive versus the brain.
The 3rd eye can take in excess data,
it has rods and cones just like your regular eyes and they can go omnidirectional whereas our eyes are limited to our front 170 degree line of sight.


Q: What are the mechanics when using LIGHT LANGUAGE?
When I am speaking light language it is all about what the throat chakra is doing.
All of my senses observing the vocal patterns that the reality is observing through the throat chakra.
The knowingness is in the heart but the completeness of the manifestation,
just like with any other skill,
the final manifestation is in the voice,
the throat chakra.
I am setting a tone and a frequency.
There will be people who don’t know what that language is but they know there is an intonation and a body language and an auric field that is interacting with it is also giving off psychic information that is also the sign form of light language.
So when you are light language speaking you are using all parts of your body for the final manifestation for how the reality interprets it as an observer or an unentangled observer.
That is the other side of light language you can speak to unentangled observers and be unentangled yet they still get their point across.

You have that right at all times to speak to them.
That is the I AM presence apex of this hierarchical order and experience to use these words of command to be in dominion,
or communion and union with beings.
When beings are not in dominion,
communion and union their light language is greatly reduced and only the highest versions of their light bodies can perform the greatest of their tasks.
So when you have a being that is using much more light bodies that is much more in communion and union they have much more access to light languages.
When your light bodies are calibrating more with I am presence the access of engaging these types of languages through your soul and the voice box becomes easier.
The translation is more free flowing,
without a verbatim translation.
That equation setting has moments of harmony were several phrases before you speak light language can get changed and modified,
the expression of photonic light.
So I am giving codes to light itself to change an expression,
much like a kaleidoscope opening and closing a specific pattern.
And I can make multiple sets and patterns throughout the entire conversation.
It is almost we remember how to use the frequencies of the voice,
intonations to effect reality.

Q: What happens when we are reading out loud?
People often can’t annunciate words because their shadow is stopping them,
taking out the clarity of the language.
When we reading out loud is a way to see and perceive of the programs that don’t want change within us.
We are coming into the present moment,
I AM in the vagus nerve and starts chucking out programs.
Have you ever been into a book you are no longer reading the words and it’s like they are existing in your head?
Being transported beyond the words.
