## Faith

Faith is a choice.
It's a part of consciousness,
part of the responsibility assigned to us as he architects of our reality.
Most people don't assume that responsibility,
but it's given to us nonetheless.
Faith restricts our choices,
indeed,
sometimes it denies a choice.
There are moments where faith propels us into experience and the other side of the experience instantaneously,
yielding a powerful experience in light memory which we call metaphysical.
The NDE can create faith.
A person who was an atheist can come out of an NDE with faith in god and the other side.
This clears out all the negative programming around non-judgmental belief programming.
It's faith without an agenda.
Spirit and faith work through us,
not against us.
Our judgment and condemnation make us think the universe is working against us.
Faith is a choice until surrender to spirit is no longer a choice,
instead,
an extended flow of experience.
We can choose to stop the experience at any time but we donâ€™t.
