Our DNA skinsuits have a potential to work within eight colors and nine bodies.
This is superluminal thinking,
our DNA birth right as a lineage being.
We are currently a seven color time experiencing world.
The vast majority of worlds out there are two or three colors.
A smaller percentage are four,
five.
and six color worlds.
Arcturians and Pleiadians have multiple frequencies of individual time on the surface of their planets,
but their worlds don't use Roman numeral time.
They can use dozens of colors and create more if the factions on the planet choose.
We have a variety of beings who come to our seven color world.
Their DNA can only experience three colors,
but their world allows them to have layers of reality.
We live in a multi-layered uni-world.
There are two color beings right next to us,
layered on top of us,
aware of us and unaware of us
&mdash;
rocks,
walls,
and blades of grass.
They're two color life force energies experiencing time.
A three color being experiencing time might be something like a cricket,
or a clan of crickets,
which is actually one soul,
or a hive of bees,
which be two souls in six or seven thousands bees.

Let’s say in the foetus in the womb blueprint process a previous *I am* that used to be a 2 colour experiencing being determines that it wants to elevate to a 3,
4,
5 colour being.
It will then go to the astral city soul family related to them in the NORTHPOLE (past) Aurora Borealis and spend time there charting a course of what types of soul families it wants to work with before it transits to the SOUTHPOLE (future) signalling to earth mother to enter the EARTH incarnation grid.
There is where it will spend a frequency what is called blue road time in which it comes into the foetus state.
It waits for an egg or sperm or seed which has its own technology and chooses the right astral process to become an animated being.
As a sperm based being the mother and father create the portal of the lineage and the being that is in the blue road astral time becomes the first spark.
The nine month gestation process is where the former 2 colour being learns to experience all 7 colours of time through their parents.
That is the first imprint upon the foetus in the womb process.
This is why it's so vital as practitioners of our own healing that we return to the foetus in the womb state and once again get communal access to the growth of the blueprint to be able to create changes.
Upon birth the foetus forgets everything that happened in the astral worlds,
all the programming it has done in the North and South Pole.
It no longer remembers that it had access to the earth mother’s incarnation grid and that it planned its life with the tens of thousands of beings and made spiritual contracts to create true and false synchronicities.
It no longer is aware of all temporary synchronicities that put it on multiple frequencies or timelines because this is a 100 % free willed universe.
Free for all denizens where the domination and control exists,
tries to predict our life journeys whilst we learn to plan big and long term.

Q:
Can we say more on the prediction of us through the system?
The system gets to read our spiritual contracts that we are making with everyone else and makes a prediction of how effective we are going to be at it and it's going to put things in our way called karmas.
Karmas are a repetition process that usually have no illumination as the system wants to make sure that the foetus in the womb is working extra hard during the nine months where it has infinite access to all the physical beings in and out of manifestation until its birth.
This is the time of the greatest amount of light where this being can be in service and contribution to a master collective of beings of light who are still an uncollective during the time of the initial spark’s creation.
That leads to the great forgetting and the living and growing of beings in mass processes in which we are creating new generations of beings who are now existing with race amnesia.
The system has been selectively redating aspects of history so there is not a common colloquial representation to rely on thus why the mandala effect is a consequence in retribution for those that are manipulating the natural order.
We are now getting to the point of evolution of this particular world where the previous systems of control,
the apparatus of domination and control,
can no longer predict what that previous 2 colour time being was going to do in its infinite state of prediction and blueprint.

Q:
What can we do as conscious beings on the path of consciousness exploration to inspire change?
Lead a life path where consciousness exploration is a protected sacred ritual for our future selves in which we are a discerned practitioner of discipline.
By doing these things here in the now we are affirming and confirming to the unseen world we are ready for the next layer of unfolding.
The more responsibility we take for our own awareness the more we impact on the consciousness of millions of global beings.
Stop smoking the ‘hopium’ pipe and allow our authentic truth,
that our inner genius can spark forward at any moment in time to wow this world with a song,
inspiring words,
artwork,
or a business.
Do whatever we desire with such force and impact on the self that the world will look our way,
be inspired and empowered by our contributions.
It's all about living as sovereign masters in the sacred neutral,
creating multiple hubs of interconnectivity,
being joyful and compassionate whilst living and creating without end.
We are all in it for the universal conscious community to win it.
How can we use the system against itself?
I will go and learn about what makes this world a greater place as part of my inner martial arts discipline as the eternal student and self-illuminated master no longer dependent on external gurus but seeking peers as true impeccable teachers in my reality.

Q:
How does faith feature in the consciousness exploration journey?
Faith is a choice as it's part of consciousness,
part of our responsibility of being the architect of our reality.
Faith also have the sides of it that are non-choice.
There are those moments where faith propels us onto to the bridge of experience and puts us on the other side instantaneously,
which gives us a powerful experience in light memory which we call metaphysical.
A near death experience,
a person who was an atheist comes out and has now faith in god and the other side.
That cleared out all of the negative programming that is around the non-judgemental belief programming.
Faith on the non-agenda level.
Spirit and faith is working through us and not against us.
It's our judgment and condemnation that make us think that the universe is working against us.
It's choice until surrender to spirit's no longer choice but an extended flow of experience.
We can choose to stop the experience at any time but we don’t.


FEELINGS & ENERGY HARVESTING:

Q:
How do feelings lower the harmonic wavelength?
Very carefully,
certain feelings have a certain vibration that we put out that alters our light.
Anger can raise our frequency and our vibration but it will push things away from we or will look at matching something with we so that anger goes from we into something and back into we… getting back into the law of charge and polarity.
This then makes we a perfect subject for energy harvesting or negative thoughts,
feelings,
creation of internal demons.
Once we step out of the zone that we could be harvested it means our daily practice has meant something to we over  a period of time that creates a vibration in we that is ever present that denies low vibration but high frequency beings interfering with we.

Q:
What do we mean by HIGH FREQUENCY AND LOW VIBRATION INTERFERENCE….
Negative beings can be high frequency beings and low vibration.
They hit us with a high frequency wave,
we respond to and then they lower our frequency to their level.
Let’s say we have a person that is not in charge of their *I am*ness,
has a ghost in them that is hungry,
and it influences we to blow up at we in a road rage incident sending all this toxic rage at we.
As soon as we scream back form most people they have already entangled with it and the interfering being is feeding off both sides through the exchange of charge and polarity -  a high frequency exchange of charge and polarity.

Q:
How does one respond to a high frequency,
low vibration interference?
When the energy hits we from a high consciousness being we can respond in many different ways and we don’t have to exchange energy.
And that’s just a choice that we make as an intention.
There is baby and adult intention and then a practiced disciplined person over time can make this at a choice all the time.
Just who we are can out-vibrate a person and that usually triggers competition in the other person.
Non-competition,
non-hierarchy,
as a state of emanation is a state of out vibrating and out creating them so that their energies can’t stick and force an exchange of force and polarity.
Understanding why other people act the way they do we are empathetically entangling with them.
Theses are those false synchronicities that we are creating within ourselves where we are not realising that we empathise with them in order to understand them.
IF YOU THINK YOU WON’T BE ABLE TO STAND A WORLD IN WHICH LIVING IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN UNDERSTANDING THEN GIVE UP MAGIC NOW.
Most of the time understanding is a very limited form of experience.
It’s a micro part of a greater memory and often understanding leads us into curiosity learning because we use it in the mechanical form albeit indoctrinated through the global narrative of having to understand each other.
