CHAPTER VII:
 SIGNATURE FREQUENCY TEACHING – THE LAWS OF ATTRACTION AND REPULSION INSIDE AND OUTSIDE CONSCIOUSNESS ENTANGLEMENT.

Q:
 What is a signature frequency?
 You are an I AM self driven wave form in a bubble of reality that has physics adjusting you to your harmony,
 vibration and frequency based on your ability to propagate life in equal co-creation and non-hierarchy with your celestial counterparts.
 Your signature frequency is a naturally evolving attraction process in coherently aligning to the seen and unseen world based off raw vibration,
 frequency,
 harmony.
 When our cognitive mind gets involved in it you often are forcing a match that is in our time-space equation for which you might not be ready yet.
 Depending on the level of your awareness that can easily turn into an instant gratification journey.

Q:
 What makes you a match to a signature frequency?
 What makes you a match to this material?
 It is not necessarily about your consciousness.
 Our agencies work at the universal source level because we are universal beings resolving universal karma at any moment in time.
 The I AM just happens to be the time spaced cognitive manifestation in all awareness that is fractionalising around you.
 Spirituality is beginning to make sense within the infinite fractional or great mystery and begins to be clued in to its moods and themes.
 The great mystery is never going to be solved but it is going to give you some foreshadowing and sometimes even predictions.
 THE COLLECTIVE CONSCIOUSNESS IS A LIMITATION – YOU’VE GOT TO THINK BEYOND THAT.
 The individual and the collective consciousness will always be a limitation as we are infinitely evolving beings with infinite possibilities available to us.
 You can be a signature frequency match individually,
 collectively or separately and as I said it has nothing to do with your consciousness.
   Like creates like and dislike creates dissonance.
 Your consciousness gives consent but the universal frequency,
 vibration and harmony can match you without your consciousness entanglement.

Q:
 What is a forced signature frequency match?
 You have to take responsibility at the level of awareness to become a coherent vibrational match.
 Whenever you are trying to cognitively force a match you are not in the state of emanation allowing the natural ways of the universe to naturally fractionalise and align synchronicities,
 harmony,
 vibration,
 frequency with you.
 AS LONG AS YOU ARE TRYING TO CONTROL THE OUTCOME YOU MISSED THE EXPERIENCE.
 It is like a song felt in the heart.
 As a base understanding you have to perceive first and then cognitise what is a natural neutral being versus a being of charge and polarity.
 Have you ever come across someone who is trying to match your signature frequency?
 What does it feel like?
 Kind of sticky,
 eeky,
 needy,
 the dating world would be a good example of that.
 We are potent and can out-create anything and anyone with the potency of a few blinks if we believe in our potency,
 with faith in ourself that has self-mastery,
 discipline and love as its foundations.
 The system of domination and control is a forced signature frequency match as it uses its foundation to make a prediction model.

Q:
 What is tacit consent & being sovereign?
 Tacit consent is when we adhere and fall for their forced evolution in unknowingness You must acknowledge and learn how to own your unseen consenting process.
 No answer is still an answer.
 No choice is still a choice.
 Sovereignty Is the full right and power to be a governing body of one's own self,
 without any interference from outside sources or bodies seen and unseen,
 physical and nonphysical.
 It is your free will expression at all levels of experience.
 Declarations of Sovereignty and non consent are magic as they undo spells and commitments you made without having full knowledge or memory.
 Claiming sovereignty will begin to transform your life and allow you to co create in your full capacity as a free willed multi-dimensional,
 universal being.
 To be sovereign we must practice free will at all times
Q:
 What happens in Global Mass Meditations?
 The SCHUMANN RESONANCE is part of the natural frequency,
 vibration,
 harmony signature that allows us to unify or separate as we go through a fractionalisation process.
 Think of it as a carrier wave for a given region.
 In the absence of this frequency,
 we as humans become ill.
 The same can be said if our personal frequency is too far out of alignment with the resonant frequency of an area.
 What happens in mass meditations is that these frequencies are spiking,
 basically just because a lot of beings are hitting their instruments at the same time.
 This giant wave in the celestial consciousness,
 which is its own key of creation,
 allows a greater fractionalisation to make harmony,
 frequency and vibrational matches.
  Many of the subcarrier waves then try to force the main carrier wave to conform.
 If it does not conform it allows the many others to fall into chaos which is run by the universal key.
 Long story short the carrier wave has many sub carrier waves that relates to your time-space equation as a 7th or 8th colour time being.
  When everyone uses there instruments not all have the same intentions or levels of awareness to impact on the seen and unseen worlds.
 So stay away from those mass events,
 keep your vagus nerve tuned up and let the I AM explore consciousness at the scale and size it is ready and prepared for.
 Those frequency,
 harmony,
 vibration matches that are happening a very big scale cannot always perceived,
 known,
 understood and made absolute.
 That is the limitation of consciousness and there are levels of the experience that the consciousness cannot compute.
 The signature frequency teaching ties into coherence,
 both on an individual and collective level,
 so we can actually start creating music instead of just producing noise.

Q:
 What do you mean when you talk about SACRED NEUTRAL STATE OF AWARENESS?
 Polarity takes you out of resonance with your natural frequency,
 harmony,
 vibration signature.
 When you feel everything you have the mind overwriting the heart or the other way round and they are no longer in resonance.
 Sovereign neutral is a state of observation that has no agenda.
 It is simply there to perceive the information,
 cognitively understand it but not create stories with it the present moment.
 The post being,
 together with your postcognitivie work force,
 you can use the information and create a story afterwards.
 Being in the sacred neutral point of view is a living experience that has the potential to create powerful chemical memories that can be powerful light memories that we can go back to and look at and go over in a non-sacred neutral state.
 We can retain or go back to certain memories only in the sacred neutral state.
 That’s why I am so consistent in what I do.
 I can go back to a sacred neutral place because I know there are certain memories I can only perceive and work with in the sacred neutral state.
 When you are the pure sacred neutral observer and experiencer at the edge of the unknowningness a magical flow of data is accessible to you.
 It is a state of beingness that requires trust.
 The I AM is fully 100 in the vagus nerve,
 fully in the central nervous system,
 seen and unseen,
 sympathetic and parasympathetic,
 all programs are shut off and it allows the experience to instantly create powerful chemical memories and powerful light memories that can have very long lasting effects on the beingness past,
 present and future.
 It is a state of true creation.
 Finding passion through the infinite unlimited point of view without cognitive function behind it always puts you on the edge of the unknown and makes it easy for the unknown to become known.
 Ponder that!

Q:
 What is a chemical memory versus a light memory?
 A person can continuously produce chemical memories,
 feelings,
 when stuck in programs at a very low empowered state.
 As you gain the power of the vagus nerve,
 any memory that has been layered over and camouflaged with low frequency vibration,
 can be recalled.
 We all have the capacity to remember all of our childhood memories,
 no matter how traumatic or joyful.
 Chemical memories can be overharvested and lower their frequency of the memory (other I AM memories) whereas memories made in light will continue to re-energise you.
 Light memories are mystical experience that defines the universe.
 There is a point in where the experience is so high in frequency,
 vibration and harmony,
 where finite chemicals can no longer be sustained.
 The experience is turned into an infinitely stored in light memory that lights up your consciousness.
 It is very easy for our consciousness to tune in to this bright light,
 floating memory in this fractured,
 fractionalised,
 unfractured state of beingness.
 Remember,
 FEELING IS NOT INTUITION.
 If you are a feeler you are not using your intuition correctly.
 You might think you do,
 but in all reality you are probably stuck in the empath trap.
 Intuition does not have an agenda,
 whilst feelings to.
 RAW INTUTION DOES NOT USE EMOTIONSL INPUT FOR COGNTIVE DATA.

Q:
 Does chemical memory impact on our homeostasis and synthesis?
 When the body is overloaded with chemical memory it is then going to continue to produce memories of this finite chemical level.
 At times you may have a very powerful chemical memory,
 sex,
 business… but it is not an ecstatic euphoria that lasts for months.
 You’ve had experiences that have truly motivated you  and can tell the difference between a finite and infinite experience and memory that just lasts.
 The programs that we are using generating same old broadcasts that lead to repetition and not illumination.
 With an overload of chemical memories the programs literally kick us out of the body and we are no longer present which can lead to depression,
 regression,
 obsession through entity intra and interaction.
 Chemical memories are using the body as a permanent storage unit that can create many types of degenerative diseases.
 We are being of HOMEOSTATIC SYNTHESIS,
 a state of personal freedom and awareness for growth and the patterns we create are to promote our own evolution with our purpose and place in this world.
 It is our legacy and birthright to be in synthesis with all there is was and ever will be.

Q:
 What does being present really mean?
 Present is a choice in a state where the I AM is inside the body,
 actively choosing to be in the moment of now,
 without strategy and agenda,
 so the infinite moment of now can be I AM realised,
 processing a state of presence as an ever moment to moment living.
 This is the I AM being fully in the vagus nerve,
 the mitochondrial power plants,
 fully empowered to experience the mighty moment of the now,
 inside and outside and many other linear and none-linear expressions of time – simultaneous living in the present moment.
 When you are in the vibration,
 harmony,
 frequency alignment out of a non-cognition choice.

Q:
 How do we impact the cosmos by sending out our energies?
 It is kind of like when the TV is playing in the background.
 The frequency of the TV impacts us on some level although we are not really focusing on the specific program.
 The background noises can make us slightly irritated or eventually can get us to pay attention.
 It often is far more distracting than we all want to admit.
 It also has a time-space stamp on it that does not evolve with our internal time-space equation of Roman Numeral Time.
 Just about everything you see or hear on TV is recorded in the past even most live shows are on a delay.
 Remember,
 frequencies are light and light is technology.
 Any type of sending out light waves can interfere with your or other’s light wave production as it still is unprotected technology.
 We can be like cell towers but unless we understand our potency,
 the need for sovereign boundaries and the I AM APEX fortification we are far from acting as protected technology.
 Many offworlders are here now because of us doing the work.
 It has affected them in ways we don’t understand as of yet.
 What we can say is that the universal agency is sending in top quality managers and staffers.

Q:
 How does communication through HARMONY/FREQUENCY/VIBRATION signature work?

Every communication is multidimensional in universal nature.
 An expansive communication is based on the BROADCASTER AND THE RECEIVER LOOKING AT THE MATCH OF THE 3 WAY FORMS OF INTERACTION of frequency/vibration/harmony.
 By talking to one or more in the seen world,
 a multitude of beings,
 past and future in the seen and unseen are listening.
 A high frequency statement can be low in harmony meaning that it creates powerful sparks,
 not necessarily in the now but later in time for people listening in archives and beyond.


1.
  	HARMONY:
 is related to space and time (a powerful statement creating for the future)
2.
  	FREQUENCY:
 is determining of the spark is going to ignite chemical memory that will evolve into a light based memory.

3.
      VIBRATION:
 determines the length in which the energy explosion stays present in the person in the form of euphoria or dopamine release of something else that keeps the experience going.
 Vibration creates a resonance or an echo factor inside the human’s central core,
 central nervous system.
 Programs are stuck inside traumas,
 sub echos inside the CNS creating this information that is hard for high or low vibration teachings to get through to the central nervous system.
 There are times where I am building the energy up in a normal conversation.
 I am cognitively aware I am raising my frequency,
 raising my vibration,
 like tidal waves pounding and all of a sudden the program drops in 30 or 150 people and there is that flood of vibration into them which then creates a chemical response that is not fight,
 flight,
 freeze but surrender.


Q:
 Can we talk about choice with regards to the Signature Frequency?
 HARMONY/FREQUENCY/VIBRATION creates an equation where the conscious mind is consciously trying to entangle out of choice.
 That is a separate journey from the journey of charge & polarity.
 Signature frequency moment of the now has the non-cognition and then the cognition process.
 There is an agenda us who is always trying to force matches out of choice.
 Choice is technically trying to force the universe to conform.
 There are certain choices that are backed with daily practice,
 blissfulness,
 joy and all those other things that aren’t really forcing but allowing the spirit of god and the universe source,
 whatever you want to call it,
 to work with us and through us in a non-competition process.
 At that level of co-creation synchronicities can be aligned that create blissful awareness and experiences and we don’t force them out of a need to control.

Q:
 Could you define FREQUENCY in this context?
 Think of frequency as the intensity of light emission.
 So,
 frequency determines how much ability you have to affect everything that’s in one degree of separation of you on all dimensions,
 time streams,
 and existences.
 the spark,
 intensity,
 potency creating a light memory that later solidifies.
 That potent power of a blink in a middle of a speech that effects everyone.
 9 words in a speech,
 I have a dream MLK… expressing the frequency of him being present in his body,
 fully in his central nervous system,
 broadcasting his light out of choice.
 Frequency will determine how much you can set other beings to by burning fuel,
 stagnant energy to raise their frequency.
 It doesn’t come from words but your presence in your body,
 how much light you are exuding.
 You can be a high frequency being in a low vibration:
 you spike,
 you drop,
 you spike,
 you drop.
 Frequency is an experience but it may not be congnitive experiences with regards to universal vibration and harmony because there is no cognition when you making signature frequency match to the moments of now.

Q:
 How do we define VIBRATION?
 Vibration is connected to a period of time.
 How long can you stay present in your body?
 The longer waveform,
 where frequency can spark up high producing a lot of light like a lighthouse,
 versus your vibration is always putting that much light out.
 It’s like how much light are you putting out over a longer period of time….
 HOW PRESENT YOU ARE AS A DNA INSTRUMENT EXPERIENCE OVER LONGER PERIOD OF TIMES.
 Technically we can use vibration as the container but the body is an instrument of experience and vibration is an experience too.

Q:
 What is meant by HARMONY?
 How you can none cognitively match the environment around you using frequency and vibration and pattern moment to moment to moment in a none-congnitive,
 none-linear,
 none pattern recognition way,
 naturally in harmony with that blade of grass,
 naturally in harmony with all projections of the natural world to you.
 You have to go into the none-choice to truly understand frequency,
 harmony and vibration – it is more than looking at sacred neutral.
 There is none-cognitive,
 non-choice part of you that is in this reality that has a base harmony,
 frequency,
 vibration that is influenced by how much we are creating experiences in aware or unawareness.
 Our skinsuits are programmed to harmony – that other 20% - 7% harmony,
 frequency,
 vibration and the remaining 13% makes up how spiritual codes and contracts unfold in linear and none-linear time.
 What agencies you work or don’t work with as well as how non-time beings can consciously entangle with the time based you to create a brand new contract that is need for change,
 auditing of the self (dark night of the soul)
Q:
 How can we practice HARMONY/FREQUENCY/VIBRATION ALIGNMENT?
  There is all sorts of guided meditation that can help you understand the pendulum of harmony,
 frequency,
 vibration that you are,
 always have been and ever will be.
 You created a pattern long before you were awake and now you are using  conscious choice to continue this creation and become more aware of the patterns.
 Balance is acknowledging two sides with a part in the middle saying don’t compete with those sides.
 Sound Therapy is a very effective tool to work with harmony,
 frequency and vibration.
 Have you ever experienced the sound waves created by playing a GONG or singing bowls?
  There  you are being bathed in frequency,
 harmony,
 vibration.
 When people have strong reactions in a gong bath it is the frequency emission that can create chaos within them putting their programs on the defence.
 They can’t really process the information carried by the the sounds,
 the continuous interchange of authority between them and their programs.
 It can be challenging to stay in your body throughout such an experience as the programs can keep interfering with your sovereignty rules.
 Any form of sound,
 the out loud name it to claim it system,
 that right away allows you to be a frequency,
 harmony,
 vibration via your vocal expression.
 It is saying to the programs,
 this is me,
 in me,
 for me,
 as me and you are not me,
 you are a part of me.
 When you record and listen to your voice you have to go through the cognition of your own vibration,
 frequency and harmony as a subconscious match and none-match.
 Swimming in the ocean,
 boating on a lake,
 walking,
 athletics,
 sacred places,
 ceremony,
 nature….
 Are these just conscious or unconscious entanglements or are they experiences beyond chemical finite comprehension ?
 There are people living next to a sacred place that is constantly effecting them in unawareness.
 The goal is to get the stagnant electromagnetic energy out of the body to become a match to vibration,
 harmony and frequency out of a conscious entanglement and disentanglement through a cognitive and non-cognitive process.

Q:
 How does DENSITY impact our DNA Instrument of experience?
 Density determines the ultimate power level,
 micro vaults versus macro vaults.
 There comes a point where the 7 chakras we are looking at via perception become micro vaults and we access our 8th chakra that becomes macro vaults,
 the 8th to our 16th chakras becomes micro vaults and then the next level becomes macro vaults as we begin to learn to operate on the different scales of time that require our awareness base to understand the original awareness was in micro vaults,
 became macro vaults,
 becomes micro vaults to become a macro vault awareness at the next level of density which allows you access to the lateral dimensions of awareness.
 There is an infinite amount of dimensions and our DNA skinsuit gives us access  off our DENSITY.
 Talking about dimension versus density,
 the more density we have in our embodied state (the more soul shards integrated) the more dimensions we can perceive.
 Our skinsuits can perceive 50 colours of time which means that if we were 99% on the way to highest form of awareness,
 awakening as high masters we could perceive tens of thousands of dimensions.
 Every dimension can have an infinite amount of life form in it or no lifeform but infinite awareness.
 Not all dimensions have tangible or intangible space or constructs that are sharable and not all dimensions are a hologram either.

Q:
 Can you elaborate more on the colours of time and the FOETUS OF THE WOMB PROCESS?
 Our DNA skinsuits have a potential to work within 8 colours and 9 bodies.
 This would require though consciousness to be willing to drive the DNA experience @ 2000 miles an hour and break the mock barrier.
 Here we are talking about super LUMINAL THINKING which is your DNA birth right as a DNA lineage being.
 Whilst you have the technology of super luminal thinking you may not be able to fully explore that just yet.
 Take a younger soul riding its consciousness @200 miles an hour for a few lifetimes but eventually is going to crash.
 Currently in our world we are a 7 colour time experiencing world.
 The vast majority of worlds out there is 2 or 3 colours.
 A smaller percentage are 4,
5 and 6 colour worlds ie Arcturians,
 Pleiadians they can have multiple frequencies of individual time on the surface of the planet but their worlds don't use roman numeral time.
 They can use dozens of colours and create more if the factions on the planet choose it.
 You can have a variety of beings that come to a 7 colour world.
 Their DNA can only experience 3 colours but their world allows them to have layers of reality.
 We live in a multi layered UNI WORLD.
 There are 2 colour experiencing beings right next to you,
 layered on top of you,
 aware of you and unaware of you.
 The rocks,
 the wall,
 the blades of grass are life force energy of 2 colour experiencing time.
 A 3 colour experiencing time might be something like a cricket or a clan of crickets that is actually one soul or a hive of bees that may be two souls in six or seven thousands bees.

Let’s say in the foetus in the womb blueprint process a previous I AM that used to be a 2 colour experiencing being determines that it wants to elevate to a 3,
4,
5 colour being.
 It will then go to the astral city soul family related to them in the NORTHPOLE (past) Aurora Borealis and spend time there charting a course of what types of soul families it wants to work with before it transits to the SOUTHPOLE (future) signalling to earth mother to enter the EARTH incarnation grid.
 There is where it will spend a frequency what is called blue road time in which it comes into the foetus state.
 It waits for an egg or sperm or seed which has its own technology and chooses the right astral process to become an animated being.
 As a sperm based being the mother and father create the portal of the lineage and the being that is in the blue road astral time becomes the first spark.
 The nine month gestation process is where the former 2 colour being learns to experience all 7 colours of time through their parents.
 That is the first imprint upon the foetus in the womb process.
 This is why it is so vital as practitioners of your own healing that you return to the foetus in the womb state and once again get communal access to the growth of the blueprint to be able to create changes.
 Upon birth the foetus forgets everything that happened in the astral worlds,
 all the programming it has done in the North and South Pole.
 It no longer remembers that it had access to the earth mother’s incarnation grid and that it planned its life with the tens of thousands of beings and made spiritual contracts to create true and false synchronicities.
 It no longer is aware of all temporary synchronicities that put it on multiple frequencies or timelines because this is a 100 % free willed universe.
 Free for all denizens where the domination and control exists,
 tries to predict our life journeys whilst we learn to plan big and long term.

Q:
 Can you say more on the prediction of us through the system?
 The system gets to read your spiritual contracts that you are making with everyone else and makes a prediction of how effective you are going to be at it and it is going to put things in your way called karmas.
 Karmas are a repetition process that usually have no illumination as the system wants to make sure that the foetus in the womb is working extra hard during the nine months where it has infinite access to all the physical beings in and out of manifestation until its birth.
 This is the time of the greatest amount of light where this being can be in service and contribution to a master collective of beings of light who are still an uncollective during the time of the initial spark’s creation.
 That leads to the great forgetting and the living and growing of beings in mass processes in which we are creating new generations of beings who are now existing with race amnesia.
 The system has been selectively redating aspects of history so there is not a common colloquial representation to rely on thus why the mandala effect is a consequence in retribution for those that are manipulating the natural order.
 We are now getting to the point of evolution of this particular world where the previous systems of control,
 the apparatus of domination and control,
 can no longer predict what that previous 2 colour time being was going to do in its infinite state of prediction and blueprint.

Q:
 What can we do as conscious beings on the path of consciousness exploration to inspire change?
 Lead a life path where consciousness exploration is a protected sacred ritual for your future selves in which you are a discerned practitioner of discipline.
 By doing these things here in the now you are affirming and confirming to the unseen world you are ready for the next layer of unfolding.
 The more responsibility you take for your own awareness the more you impact on the consciousness of millions of global beings.
 Stop smoking the ‘hopium’ pipe and allow your authentic truth,
 that your inner genius can spark forward at any moment in time to wow this world with a song,
 inspiring words,
 artwork,
 or a business.
 Do whatever you desire with such force and impact on the self that the world will look your way,
 be inspired and empowered by your contributions.
 It is all about living as sovereign masters in the sacred neutral,
 creating multiple hubs of interconnectivity,
 being joyful and compassionate whilst living and creating without end.
 We are all in it for the universal conscious community to win it.
 How can we use the system against itself?
 I will go and learn about what makes this world a greater place as part of my inner martial arts discipline as the eternal student and self-illuminated master no longer dependent on external gurus but seeking peers as true impeccable teachers in my reality.

Q:
 How does faith feature in the consciousness exploration journey?
 Faith is a choice as it is part of consciousness,
 part of our responsibility of being the architect of our reality.
 Faith also have the sides of it that are non-choice.
 There are those moments where faith propels us onto to the bridge of experience and puts us on the other side instantaneously,
 which gives us a powerful experience in light memory which we call metaphysical.
 A near death experience,
 a person who was an atheist comes out and has now faith in god and the other side.
 That cleared out all of the negative programming that is around the non-judgemental belief programming.
 Faith on the non-agenda level.
 Spirit and faith is working through us and not against us.
 It is our judgment and condemnation that make us think that the universe is working against us.
 It is choice until surrender to spirit is no longer choice but an extended flow of experience.
 We can choose to stop the experience at any time but we don’t.


FEELINGS & ENERGY HARVESTING:

Q:
 How do feelings lower the harmonic wavelength?
 Very carefully,
 certain feelings have a certain vibration that you put out that alters your light.
 Anger can raise your frequency and your vibration but it will push things away from you or will look at matching something with you so that anger goes from you into something and back into you… getting back into the law of charge and polarity.
 This then makes you a perfect subject for energy harvesting or negative thoughts,
 feelings,
 creation of internal demons.
 Once you step out of the zone that you could be harvested it means your daily practice has meant something to you over  a period of time that creates a vibration in you that is ever present that denies low vibration but high frequency beings interfering with you.

Q:
 What do you mean by HIGH FREQUENCY AND LOW VIBRATION INTERFERENCE….
 Negative beings can be high frequency beings and low vibration.
 They hit us with a high frequency wave,
 we respond to and then they lower our frequency to their level.
 Let’s say you have a person that is not in charge of their I AMness,
 has a ghost in them that is hungry,
 and it influences you to blow up at you in a road rage incident sending all this toxic rage at you.
 As soon as you scream back form most people they have already entangled with it and the interfering being is feeding off both sides through the exchange of charge and polarity -  a high frequency exchange of charge and polarity.

Q:
 How does one respond to a high frequency,
 low vibration interference?
 When the energy hits you from a high consciousness being you can respond in many different ways and you don’t have to exchange energy.
 And that’s just a choice that you make as an intention.
 There is baby and adult intention and then a practiced disciplined person over time can make this at a choice all the time.
  Just who you are can out-vibrate a person and that usually triggers competition in the other person.
 Non-competition,
 non-hierarchy,
 as a state of emanation is a state of out vibrating and out creating them so that their energies can’t stick and force an exchange of force and polarity.
 Understanding why other people act the way they do you are empathetically entangling with them.
 Theses are those false synchronicities that we are creating within ourselves where we are not realising that we empathise with them in order to understand them.
 IF YOU THINK YOU WON’T BE ABLE TO STAND A WORLD IN WHICH LIVING IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN UNDERSTANDING THEN GIVE UP MAGIC NOW.
 Most of the time understanding is a very limited form of experience.
 It’s a micro part of a greater memory and often understanding leads us into curiosity learning because we use it in the mechanical form albeit indoctrinated through the global narrative of having to understand each other.
