## Chemical Memory

Chemical memories are perpetual.
They're produced by feelings when we're stuck in programs at a very low empowered state.
As we gain the power of the vagus nerve,
any memory that has been layered over and camouflaged with low frequency vibration can be recalled.
We have the capacity to remember our childhood memories,
no matter how traumatic or joyful.
Light memories are the mystical experience that defines the universe.
There's a point where the experience is so high in frequency finite chemicals can't be sustained.
The experience is turned into an infinitely stored in light memory that lights up our consciousness.
It's very easy for our consciousness to tune in to this bright light.


When the body is flooded with chemical memory it continues to produce memories of this finite chemical level.
At times we may have a very powerful chemical memory
&mdash;
sex,
business,
travel adventure
&mdash;
but it's not an ecstatic euphoria that lasts for months.
Weâ€™ve had experiences which motivated us.
We can tell the difference between a finite and an infinite experience.
An overload of chemical memories can kick us out of our body.
We're no longer present.
This can lead to depression,
regression,
or obsession.
Chemical memories use the body as a permanent storage unit.
They create many degenerative diseases.
We are beings of homeostatic synthesis.
It's a state of personal freedom,
awareness,
and the patterns we create promote our own evolution.
It's our legacy and birthright to be in synthesis with all there is,
was,
and ever will be.


Presence is a choice.
The *I am* is inside the body.
It chooses to be in the moment of now without a strategy or an agenda.
This is how now can be *I am* realized,
by processing a state of presence as moment to moment living.
This is the *I am* being fully in the vagus nerve.
