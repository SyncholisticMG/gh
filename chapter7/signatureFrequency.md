## Signature

We are *I am* self driven wave forms in a bubble of reality.
The physics of it all adjusts you to our harmony,
vibration,
and frequency based on our ability to propagate life in equal co-creation and non-hierarchy with our celestial counterparts.
Our signature frequency is a naturally evolving attraction process coherently aligned to the seen and unseen world by raw vibration,
frequency,
and harmony.


Our agencies work at the universal source level.
We are universal beings resolving universal karma at any moment in time.
Collective consciousness is a limitation
&mdash;
weâ€™ve got to think beyond it.
Like creates like.
Dislike creates dissonance.
Our consciousness gives consent,
but the universal frequency,
vibration,
and harmony can match us without our consciousness entanglement.
We have to take responsibility at the level of awareness to become a coherent vibrational match.
Whenever we're trying to cognitively force a match we're not in the state of emanation allowing the natural ways of the universe to naturally fractionalize and align synchronicities,
harmony,
vibration,
frequency with you.
As long as we are trying to control the outcome we miss the experience.

Polarity takes us out of resonance with our natural frequency.
When we feel everything,
we have the heart overwriting the mind,
or the other way round,
and they're no longer in resonance.
Sovereign neutral is a state of observation with no agenda.
It's simply there to perceive the information,
cognitively understand it,
but not create stories with it in the present moment.
We can use the information and create a story afterwards with our postcognitive work force.
The sacred neutral point of view is a living experience.
It has the potential to create powerful chemical memories.
They can become powerful light memories we can go back and look at in a non-sacred neutral state.
Remember,
though,
we can retain or go back to certain memories only in the sacred neutral state.
When we are the pure sacred neutral observer at the edge of the knowing,
a magical flow of data is accessible to us.
It's a state of being that requires trust.
The *I am* is one hundred percent in the vagus nerve,
the central nervous system,
seen and unseen,
sympathetic and parasympathetic,
all programs shut off,
the experience creates powerful chemical and light memories.
They effect our being in the past,
present,
and future.
It's a state of true creation.
Finding passion through the infinite unlimited point of view puts us on the edge of the unknown,
making it easy for the unknown to become known.



When the TV is playing in the background the frequency of the TV impacts us on some level.
The background noises irritates us.
We might have to pay attention.
There's a time-space stamp on it misaligned with our internal time-space equation of Roman numeral time.
Everything on TV is recorded in the past.
Most live shows are on a delay.
Frequencies are light and light is technology.
Any type of light waves can interfere with our light wave production.
We are unsecured technology.
Unless we understand our potency,
the need for sovereign boundaries,
and the *I am* apex fortification,
we are far from acting as secured technology.


Harmony is related to space and time.
Frequency determines if a spark ignites chemical memory that will evolve into a light based memory.
Vibration determines the time the energy stays present in the person as euphoria,
a dopamine release,
or something else that keeps the experience going.
Vibration creates a resonance inside our central nervous system.
Programs are stuck inside traumas,
like an echo in our consciousness,
bouncing through the canyons of time.


Harmony,
frequency,
and vibration create an equation the conscious mind entangles by choice.
That is separate from the journey of charge and polarity.
The signature frequency of the now has non-cognition then cognition as its process.
There's an agenda in us who is always trying to force matches out of choice.
Choice is trying to force the universe to conform.
Certain choices are backed with daily practice,
blissfulness,
joy,
and all the other things not forcing but allowing the spirit of god,
or whatever we want to call it,
to work with and through us in non-competition.
At that level of co-creation synchronicities are aligned to create bliss if we don't force them out of a need to control.


Frequency can be conceptualized as the intensity of light emission.
Frequency determines the ability we have to affect everything in one degree of separation from us on all dimensions,
time streams,
and existences,
the spark,
the intensity,
the potency creating light memories that solidify,
a blink in the middle of a speech that effects everyone,
four words in a speech
&mdash;
I have a dream
&mdash;
the frequency of Martin Luther King present in his body,
fully in his central nervous system,
broadcasting his light out of choice.
There comes a point where breaking it down is just meaningless.
It's beautiful,
and beauty is a whole thing,
not a deconstructed thing.
