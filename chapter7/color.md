## Color


Our DNA skinsuits have a potential to work within eight colors and nine bodies.
This is superluminal thinking,
our DNA birth right as a lineage being.
We are currently a seven color time experiencing world.
The vast majority of worlds out there are two or three colors.
A smaller percentage are four,
five.
and six color worlds.
Arcturians and Pleiadians have multiple frequencies of individual time on the surface of their planets,
but their worlds don't use Roman numeral time.
They use dozens of colors and create more if the factions on the planet agree.
We have a variety of beings who come to our seven color world.
Their DNA can only experience three colors,
but their world allows them to have layers of reality.
We live in a multi-layered uni-world.
There are two color beings right next to us all the time,
layered on top of us,
aware of us and unaware of us
&mdash;
rocks,
walls,
and blades of grass.
They're two color life force energies experiencing time.
A three color being experiencing time might be something like a cricket,
or a clan of crickets,
which is actually one soul,
or a hive of bees,
which be two souls in six or seven thousands bees.

If in the fetus in the womb blueprint process a previous *I am* that was a two color experiencing being determines it wants to ascend to a three,
four,
or five color being.
It goes to the astral city soul family related to it in the North Pole
&mdash;
representing the past
&mdash;
the Aurora Borealis,
and it spends time there charting a course of soul family types it wants to work with before it transits to the South Pole
&mdash;
representing the future
&mdash;
signaling to earth mother the being wishes to enter the earth incarnation grid.
It spends a frequency,
what is called *blue road time*,
in which it comes into the fetus state.
It waits for an egg,
sperm,
or seed which has its own technology,
and it chooses the right astral process to become an animated being.
As a sperm based being the mother and father create the portal of the lineage and the being that is in the blue road astral time becomes the first spark.


The nine month gestation process is where the former two color being learns to experience all seven colors of time through the parents.
That is the first imprint upon the fetus in the womb process.
This is why it's so vital as practitioners of our own healing that we return to the fetus in the womb state and once again get communal access to the growth of the blueprint to allow changes.
The fetus forgets everything that happened in the astral worlds,
all the programming in the North and South Pole.
It forgets it had access to the earth motherâ€™s incarnation grid,
and that it planned its life with the tens of thousands of beings,
and made spiritual contracts to create true and false synchronicities.
It no longer is aware of all temporary synchronicities that put it on multiple frequencies or timelines because this is a one hundred percent free will universe.
