## Energy Harvesting


Feelings ca lower our harmonic wavelength.
Certain feelings have a vibration which alters our light.
Anger can raise our frequency and our vibration,
but it pushes things away from us,
or it cycles us into a charge and discharge loop.
This then makes us a perfect subject for energy harvesting
&mdash;
negative thoughts,
feelings,
creation of internal demons.
When we disavow harvesting,
step out of the zone where we could be harvested,
it means our daily practice has meant something to us over a period of time.
It created an ever present vibration in us that denies low vibration piracy attempts.



Negative beings can be high frequency beings and low vibration.
They hit us with a high frequency wave.
We respond then they lower our frequency to their level.
A person who is not in charge of their *I am* has a hungry ghost [1^] in them.

Hungry ghost is one of the six modes of existence. Hungry ghosts are pitiable creatures with huge, empty stomachs. They have pinhole mouths, and their necks are so thin they cannot swallow, so they remain hungry. Beings are reborn as hungry ghosts because of their greed, envy and jealousy. Hungry ghosts are also associated with addiction, obsession, and compulsion.

The Sanskrit word for hungry ghost is preta, which means departed one.

It influences people,
like when they blow up in a road rage incident.
If we scream back in rage they've entangled us and the interfering being feeds off both sides.
Understanding why other people act the way they do entangles us with them.
Empathy has its taxes.
It's galactic commerce,
remember.
False synchronicities are created within us when we don't realize that empathy allows us to learn by experience.
There's an old saying in meditation
&mdash;
the best meditation is when we no longer distinguish between ourselves and the thing meditated upon.
Understanding is a very limited form of experience.
Itâ€™s a small part of a larger memory.
Understanding leads us to curiosity learning,
because we use it in the mechanical form,
albeit indoctrinated through the global narrative of having to understand each other.
