## Akashic Record


It is the cellular memory of our earth There is a crust on our earth that is below the earth layer that is granite and granite is 65-75% crystalline and that structure in its own concept is a data storage unit as well as an interactive co-creative, spiritual, physical intra-exchange device of history. Anything that has psychic record is recorded in the akashic record.

Akashic records are a marker stone, a compass guide to truth in a society where truth is not well respected,the akashic record is a process to connect to your past, present and future lives so you can determine what layers of soul contracts you have with the planet, your soul group, your soul family,other star brothers and sisters,it’s a way to gauge personal direction to accomplishing a complete living life...The AR are a recording of every beings experience in every lifetime they’ve had on this planet and when you leave this planet and say I’m done with this experience here the planet gives you its neutral perspective so there is no polarity revealed in it of what it witnessed through your eyes as part of a shared reality experience which is downloaded into your light body dna.

The AR is a recording of every single sentient experience in this world through the neutral perspective of the planet that’s holding space for free willed life.
The solar system records all experience of all the planetary minds and all individual minds on the planet-so it’s another collective, all the stars connect to the central sun which is the collection of all experiences, which in theory is where, prime creator exists amongst all people, therefore the akashic record is the web link of all life.
