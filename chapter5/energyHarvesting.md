## Energy Harvesting Technology



Many technologies have been created to impede us.
At first glance some of them seem pretty innocuous,
but when you know how the overall system works then you know why the technologies were invented and supported.
Shoes as a technology in time and space disconnect us from the benefits of the earth energies.
Barefoot contact with the earth produces instant changes in physiological issues and stress reduction to improve the immune system.
We connect to earth’s surface electrons unhindered by shoes and feel better.

Mirrors were brought in as a way to enhance and diminish consciousness.
Reflective surfaces are the implicate observation of the self.
Portals were brought in later and added to the reflective surface.
Mirrors allowed more negative aspects for beings that weren’t ready for the exploration
&mdash;
vanity,
ego,
and other *reflection teachings* are used to masterfully manipulate and distort the self-image and the relationship with the world.
Then there is the residual image through all lifetimes which is influenced by reflective based technology.
Self-image manipulation is the principle magic of the consumer cult.
Edward Bernays was nobody's fool.
It's difficult for us to conceive of a time before radical self-image and entrancement by self-image,
especially in the large urban environments of the developed economies,
didn't exist.
It's become that normalized.
Once we mastered food production and some of the more mundane but spiritually enriching aspects of the human day-to-day,
like food production,
land maintenance,
and animal captures
&mdash;
all taken over by technology based farming
&mdash;
we entered the age of the self.
They even called the hippie followup decade,
the seventies,
the *me* decade.
Once you're aware of it you can actually see it growing and festering decade by decade.
The *me* decade gave way to the eighties,
the decade of greed,
because we deserve it,
then more technology as the home computer enters the market in the nineties.
Radical self-adoration is at the root of the modern system of commerce.
All of it pivots off the original technology of mirror.





We have residual image as something the soul,
the avatar,
uses to distinguish itself between incarnations.
Every incarnation has its own image.
If we're in the same lineage over and over our residual image is an amalgamation of the previous images.
As we're existing in many lineages,
we look differently all the time.

Photographs are an enhanced reflective technology that is a direct manifestation of alchemy.
It captures a slice of light in which the consciously entangled observer can see unmanifested matter by reflection of what that time-space environment looks like in light.
Our eyes can only see a certain band of frequency that the picture captures,
even though our DNA instrument as a whole can perceive data beyond the sense of sight through our intuition.
The limited photographic view freezes some of the energetics if the entangled observer falls for the limitation through their belief engine.
It comes back to how manipulative reflective technology can be.
It has significantly changed the reflections and reinterpretations of history together with the limitations created through the judgment process inherent in unconscious observation.

Brands are a technology for energy harvesting.
Every computer has a brand behind it which is a significant portion of the global narrative.
Apple is manufactured with Chinese slave labor.
Any piece of technology built on the shoulders of living generations allows a collaboration between realities.
The brand influences the myth and how we perceive these technologies.
Future realities will not brand and market technology.
This will take out the myth and the subconscious imprinting onto our DNA.
Branding creates competition and hierarchy.
The brand imprints on how you move through reality,
how you are perceived by others.
Banana Republic,
The Gap,
and Old Navy are three fully branded clothing lines owned by one textile and design company.
If you're not up on consumer trends,
Banana Republic is the most expensive.
Their floor space in malls is more regal.
You receive more attention from a higher level sales agent.
The clothing is better stitched and designed.
The materials are more refined.
Gap is next,
then comes Old Navy,
each rung on the brand ladder lessening the qualities listed for Banana Republic.
The clothes brand may as well be the color of the dot on your forehead in the Hindu caste system.
