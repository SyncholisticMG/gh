## Co-creation



Co-creation is identified by the many choice points of free will.
They weave a tonal fabric,
a high frequency net through time and space.
It's a space of true autonomy.
There is no co-dependence.
This can happen alone or in groups capable of pure synergy.
Growth is reflected in the evolution of an agenda agreed upon over a longer period of time.
The nature of collective co-creation is all about teamwork.
Everyone in the team brings forth a unique contribution that forms a major part in the co-creation of equal value without hierarchy.
Every individual is motivated as being part of the sum of all parts to continuously grow and carry on as a clan,
a tribe,
or a nation.
All the fundamentals of us and everyone else are equal in this journey.
Whatever hierarchical perception we use is only to define a particular moment but not to create dogmas of the generation.

Procreation is the production of offspring of human kind and any other forms of life.
Gardening,
farming,
fishing,
anything that has a life enhancing aspect in the background is part of procreation.
Procreation is co-creation for the varied species involved,
right down to the insects.
There's a karmic aspect to it.
When we are creating life force the seed that is becoming the life may or may not live.
It's always karma.
Whatever we create
&mdash;
yucca and corn,
or a home,
all creation
&mdash;
is a resolution of karmic debt.
Animals in the food chain have a spiritual contract to be eaten by humans and other animals.
It's written into the life.
Insects have responsibilities so important if they disappeared our biosphere would collapse.
The interlinking of it is incredible.
What's even more incredible is how people convinced themselves a condominium in the gray skyline of a modern mega city,
take your pick
&mdash;
New Delhi,
New York,
or Shanghai
&mdqash;
is better than being barefoot on earth and surrounded by a natural soundscape.
Our bodies are designed to resonate and amplify with the natural world.

Natural environments can be cultivated in the mega cities.
Everyoneâ€™s inner genius can live in harmony without limitations.
No matter where we live,
we can grow herbs and plants and be surrounded by living energy.
A tank full of fish and algae,
no matter how big or small,
is a unique life force to co-create with.
Edible mushroom colonies are highly sentient and extremely beneficial to grow in our living environments.

We can have dense organisms in our natural living environments.
Our background thoughts and consciousness influence everything around us as observers to a state of natural co-creative growth.
We bring plants into the house during the cold winter months.
We hang them from the ceiling.
This is life surviving and thriving with and because of us
&mdash;
companions in a shared natural living space.
This living energy can clear the stagnant.
Animals do this as well.
We can feel pets coming into our space.
When dogs bark at what we see as nothing they're clearing out stagnant energy.
We can invest into a decent sized closet with shelves,
every shelf a different life force experiment.
The more dense we become with light,
the  more light we attract.


The magic available to natural living beings does not apply to people living artificial lives in mega cities.
Magic goes with nature.
The living web of life can create astounding revelations for us.
It changes how we work,
eat,
sleep,
and dream.
Take note of dream activity when we shift locals,
like leaving New York for a three week stay in the Costa Rican rainforest.
Our first night in the jungle the living frequencies of the space begin working with us,
immediately recognizing pent up and blocked energy.
If the the life force in the space is powerful enough it can operate in the super consciousness.
It can directly communicate with us in the dream state.
The third party life force that speaks in the natural world is muted in the mega cities.


Our living space tells us when something needs to be done to it.
Do we listen or not.
We intuitively know when to water our plants.
The plants tell us when they're thirsty.
Working in our garden,
trimming the trees,
weeding our flower beds,
how does that change the energy?
Often our furniture intuits when changes are needed.
Environmental intuition is possible everywhere.
Talking,
listening,
interacting,
grace and gratitude with everything around you.
The time will come where we no longer feel co-dependent on our environment but will actively start creating together.
There are long term agreements in place so the seen and unseen agendas can be greatly enhanced on both sides through manifestations.

When we move into a house,
we imprint our energy onto it.
People sometimes find it difficult to leave or sell a house.
There are energetic entanglements.
We consecrate places whether we know it or not.
We pass milestones of joy and sorrow in the same spot,
and the earth there consecrates our experiences.
Our houses appreciate us.
Our ancestors lit ceremonial fires before moving to different heights to interact with and prepare the grounds,
and to give thanks to the spirits of the land for completion of their missions and agendas.
Mindfulness is one of those awareness practices to connect to our environment and live in tune with everything around us.
