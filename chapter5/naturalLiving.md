## Natural Living


If we reduced global corruption by thirty-five percent,
we'd be at a societal consciousness to pass laws in line with natural co-creative evolution.
We could share this space with all sentient species.
We could replace the fight for survival with natural thriving.
Contemplate the benefits of an evolutionary relationship between humans and an automated workforce.
The ill-advised and oft propagated doctrine of robots stealing our jobs keeps humanity holding onto self-inflicted limitations.


The reversal of the false idea of advanced technology bastardizing our standards of living would allow us to recognize the benefits to human evolution.
We're natural living beings in an ever expanding age of quantum computing and advancing technology as part of our birthright and legacy.
Automation and robots can replace a variety of dangerous jobs.
There will always be things for humans to do.
Alternative energy alone would transform the way we live.
Liberated energy will produce liberated living.
People will no longer be forced into suburbs and cities,
which are the antithesis of living.

Integrating robotic assistance into our daily living is part of the natural evolution for advancing humanity.
Combining natural living with technology and making it work is a way of living and operating in the concrete jungle.
Any jobs lost by the automation would go into techno humanoid concepts
&mdash;
a unique interaction between man and machine.
There is no such thing as artificial intelligence taking over humanity on this planet .
It still requires us to create,
install,
operate,
and manage it.
The reduction of corruption starting at the level of global production lines can bring back real hope for a complete system change.

The next level is adapting the education system to reflect the quantum era starting at nursery and primary school level.
The school’s curriculum has to include special awareness,
art work,
working with animals and other sentient creatures to promote a deep connection to the natural learning and growth stage.
The parental responsibilities will have to change as well for both male and female.
Less corruption means more time for either or both parents to stay at home with the child and still have a place to go back to or interact with during the rearing of the child.

At thirty-five percent less corruption we should have free globally available medicine and the end of pharmaceutical corporatism running our health and well being sector.
The nature of office buildings and space would change into an environment accessible to global community services and products on diverse scales.
At the end of the day getting out of corruption is all about education.
To reach illumination we need to understand that evolution does not happen by chance,
but by the conscious choices we make.
Evolution in the sentient being is a free will choice,
not a random act foisted upon us by nature.

Look at how we govern the world.
We haven’t had a democracy for two-hundred years.
The current state of affairs opens a window of opportunity to move from opportunistic governance to a true synergistic democracy.
The banking system was weaponized in the nineteen-seventies.
Banks started dealing their own products.
Laws were passed to indemnify them for the criminal acts that followed.
The banks are corporations that own other corporations that in turn own humanity.

Hypernormalization [^1]
&mdash;
not so normal if you think about it
&mdash;
where governments,
financiers,
and technical Utopians  have created a fake world run by corporations and corrupt politicians.
We need to step out of the illusion of being trapped in those flawed Utopian ideals and realize we have the power to make a difference.
This world needs a court system that knows how to deal with crimes of passion,
a government that is transparent,
ethically aligned to the greater good of humanity,
and proactive in dealing with issues at hand.
Governing staff and experienced personnel with an adequate level of education to understand how to conserve our land and how to support its people.
We can no longer watch our forests burning to the ground because of bad conservation laws.
We’ve had fifteen years and more of defunding the management of wildfires.
There was a time where settlers and Indians worked together in the burning season because they knew they’d lose everything if they didn’t.



Getting rid of thirty-five percent of corruption would give us a chance to revamp the usage of global media.
Positive broadcasting of what is actually working in this world to inspire and stimulate the global commerce market and bring people together on a universal information platform,
instead of spreading fear and drama,
manipulating the data flow and misrepresenting the world view at large.
We have to start beating the drums in rhythm with the earth again.
There is something that is to be discovered,
new consciousness movements coming together and working as one.
