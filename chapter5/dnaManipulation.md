## Modern DNA manipulation




What has happened on this planet is almost unbelievable.
In the context of the divine hologram we need to see the good and the bad.
We need to choose.
These are standard conceptions of growth and maturity even in psychology.
The shocking part is how deep the story of deception goes.
When the negative species took over the farm they dumbed humanity down.
This happened around seventy-five thousand years ago,
long past the time wars,
well into the time chaos we live within now.

The cerebellum in the medulla oblongata at the back of the brainstem is now part of the autonomic nervous system.
It was not always so.
It used to be called the tiny back up brain.
There are reptilian species that have two and three brains because of their giant bodies.
The cerebellum was implemented into skinsuits to impede evolution
&mdash;
our journey to light and being
&mdash;
and to prevent us from performing rituals and ceremonies which would have shed light on the fake masters and gods years ago.
Medicine was brought into this hologram at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution to stunt our growth and support the global narrative's distortion and distraction.
They don't want us to remember our true nature.
In ancient times the hologram was very different.
The global narrative was based on what the *gods* told us.
The cerebellum is the limiting factor for faith itself.
The master DNA creators incorporated the cerebellum into the DNA by adding a rung,
like creating a new organ,
so we would not progress beyond certain experiences and awaken to the fact we're farmed.
Our motor cortex used to be actively in alignment with our heart,
brain,
and gut.
Now the cerebellum is completely integrated into our heart-brain-gut complex and interacts as a medium with our reality keeping us in fight,
flight,
or freeze.
This is a catatonic state for consciousness expansion.
The cerebellum can hinder us from having astral travel experiences.
We can overwrite the cerebellum with heart based meditation.
This turns off the medulla oblongata.
A super highway between the brain and heart lights up.
This is natural for human beings.




The sphenoid bone is the one with the great wings,
just behind the eye sockets,
below the frontal bone.
It joins many of the other bones in the skull.
When working on the sphenoid bone in Cranio Sacral Therapy (CST) we impact on the other bones in the skull and the face.
The sphenoid bone was radically manipulated so that our residual image would alter during our emotional journeys.
When we are depressed our eye sockets are influenced through the sphenoid bones,
the ears,
the mandibles,
the jaw position,
how the sinuses are effected,
and how much air comes in and out of the nose.
The sphenoid bone was manipulated and integrated into the facial structure so we wear our emotions on our sleeves.
It allows programs to take over sympathetic and parasympathetic control.
Sphenoid alignment is one of the greatest emotional releases we can have.
It interlinks with the parietal,
temporal,
and zygomatic in the cheek bones.
In CST when we hold the occiput and we feel for the movement of the sphenoid bone,
people with imbalances there,
are usually suffering.
It is the gyroscope of the face which is linked to residual image.
It's also linked to our capacity to be in the body and recognize our residual image.



Our inner ear bones determine how we hear the tones in our reality.
Some people are tone deaf.
Our early infant journey determines how robust these bones grow as we are align to the space-time motion and our spiritual center of gravity.
The size of these bones has been greatly reduced.
They should be four times the size.
This hinders our connection to sound and motion.
One of the tiniest bones in the ear is the the stirrup bone.
If bones in the ears were bigger we'd be more spiritually centered.
Programs would have less power over us.

The eye lashes keep dirt out and protect the eyes,
but they're also antennas just like cats whiskers.
We cannot always see them as we blink,
but they're very much part of our visionary spiritual journey.
Just like cats use their whiskers as a sensing system,
we use our eye lashes to assist us psychically.
Our tongue and eye lashes have been modified to allow the cerebellum to take control over motion action.
If they were not directly hijacked,
we'd be able to see all the other layers of reality.




Hair follicles are antennas too.
Each different skinsuit has a different quality to hair.
Our hair today when you cut it's dead.
In the past it stayed alive.
Alpaca hair under the microscope is alive.
The tubes allow light to continuously refract through them.
Our hair should be the same way.
In the military they shave off men’s hair to be able to control them better.
The wind talkers,
the native Americans,
had thick long hair.
It helped decode messages of the wind using light language.
Eye lash hair allows us to input data from other realities.
The hair as a system has been hijacked by the cerebellum.
Hair is linked to our scalp.
The scalp is related to the central location system of our file tree.
Many people have the round bald patch on top of their head.
That says their DNA is limiting parts of their crown chakra.

THE funny bone inside the elbow is a big nerve ganglion that has grown out of proportion to impact on how the skeletal system interacts with the vagus nerve.
It bypasses the skeletal system,
so we feel more through the flesh than the bones.
When our bones and hair are in sympathetic alignment,
we get the feeling of our hair standing up at the back of our neck.
They increased the funny bone size so it was more data oriented than the bones.
By being more aware of the muscle than the bone we gain strength faster and are able to lift heavy loads.
This is how the manipulation through the cerebellum sourced and maintained the slave communities.

At one point the DNA skinsuit could switch from male to female at will.
Men’s nipples remained because they couldn't remove them when they started modifying our bodies towards procreation,
as opposed to recreation.
In the past pleasure was another form of control.
It's actually making something of a comeback in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries.
We're the technology of the founders.
We're supposed to be self-entertaining,
self-educating,
and self-evolving,
but this is in context to our environment,
and this includes our inner environment,
out thoughts and beliefs.
The global narrative is now,
and has been for some time,
the context within which our innate abilities grow and adapt.
The problem is that the environment is false.
The true DNA does not know how to express the truth in a false context.
The Adam's apple is another control system to limit men’s sovereignty.
It works through the projection of the voice during the *I am* evolution at puberty.
The loss and gain of innocence was controlled in the DNA through the lineages.

We have thirty-three vertebrates in the spine instead of forty.
The side wings of the vertebrates should be a more robust expression.
Our spinal column has less vertebrates and they're bigger.
We should have smaller ones and seven more with greater space in between the vertebrates to allow more plasticity of the body itself.
With less vertebrates it's easier to become bogged down with depression programs.
In some off-world DNA skinsuits they have seventy-two vertebrates and a greater brain processing power.
Each vertebrate is a part of the brain stem connected to the vagus nerve and cerebellum.
If you take out the cerebellum,
the entire skeletal spinal column is an extension of the brain.
More vertebrates allow more interaction with the chakras beyond the crown.
Giraffes have a bigger processing power,
just like the Brontosaurus that had a ninety-foot long neck.


Our eyes and our third eye have been manipulated too.
The function of the  third eye and our pineal gland are hijacked by the cerebellum at birth.
Once you cut the umbilical cord,
the cerebellum takes over the special awareness instead of having the third eye remain in charge of awareness until puberty.
A baby with the third eye engaged at birth without cutting the cord would have a radically different perceptive capacity.

Our eye color is an aspect of the DNA and directly connected to the residual image.
A child can choose its eye color by changing it in the first few months.
It's flowing through the Cranio Sacral system,
projecting light out the eyes through the lens of their color.

The thymus gland has been manipulated also.
It still goes back to the cerebellum implant.
If you take the cerebellum out all of those manipulated and corrupted capacities would return back to normal.
At this stage of our development,
the cerebellum cannot be surgically removed without rendering the patient brain dead.
Due to the holographic reality we live in,
there are people who have sixty percent of their brain gone because of an accident and they're still alive and aware.

The appendix was originally to help process vegetable matter that was very difficult to break down.
The function of the appendix is not greatly understood now and it's often removed.
It still helps to balance the gut gnome to dampen candida,
amplify other micro organisms,
and put nutrients into the gut system to support digestion.

The tonsils were a filtration system for airborne bacteria.
They close off the air passageway to the lungs and act as a portal for fluid,
like gills,
for other atmospheric-type journeys.
Depending on the skinsuit,
it can change the sound of the voice when removed,
where removal might impact on the potency of voice projection.

In certain DNA skinsuits,
wisdom teeth have to come out for the jaw to function.
Those are modifications to limit the body.
They will rot if you don’t extract them.
Dentistry was typically a death sentence in the past.
The name *wisdom* tooth itself is a play and imprint on the belief system.
The teeth are intricately linked to the nervous system,
a vital part of what goes into our gut.
Teeth help us to relate to our residual images.
Some people can gain more of their reality through a set of fake teeth.
Heavy metal fillings,
like mercury,
create a bio-electric frequency that distorts all of the nerve endings and the chemical reactions in the dental system.
Teeth are often connected to entities.
They hijack the gut through the teeth.



The shape of the organs are determined by the size of the vertebrates.
More and smaller vertebrates would impact on the organs.
Everybody’s skinsuit has different shapes of organs.
This is the medical industry’s deep,
dark secret.
Many people have *upside down organs*
&mdash;
literally.
It's not a DNA flaw.
It's just like consciousness in the DNA lineage is organized differently to allow a different experience.
The organs are shaped differently depending on the skinsuit.
The organ positions do not change our consciousness being in the vagus nerve or the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system.
There are many DNA skinsuits off earth that have a second heart in the intestinal tract which creates extended peristalsis.
The cerebellum becomes another heart,
controlling the micro-pressure of blood flowing through the brain,
allowing brain,
heart,
gut coherence.
The heart is the first organ,
the tongue is second,
the third is our lymph system,
the thymus,
the fourth and fifth are the gut heart.
