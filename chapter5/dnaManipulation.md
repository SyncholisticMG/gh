## Modern DNA manipulation




What has happened on this planet is almost unbelievable.
In the context of the divine hologram we need to see the good and the bad.
We need to choose.
These are standard conceptions of growth and maturity even in psychology.
The shocking part is how deep the story of deception goes.
When the negative species took over the farm they dumbed humanity down.
This happened around seventy-five thousand years ago,
long past the time wars,
well into the time chaos we live within now.

The cerebellum in the medulla oblongata at the back of the brainstem is now part of the autonomic nervous system.
It was not always so.
It used to be called the tiny back up brain.
There are reptilian species that have two and three brains because of their giant bodies.
The cerebellum was implemented into skinsuits to impede evolution
&mdash;
our journey to light and being
&mdash;
and to prevent us from performing rituals and ceremonies which would have shed light on the fake masters and gods years ago.
Medicine was brought into this hologram at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution to stunt our growth and support the global narrative's distortion and distraction.
They don't want us to remember our true nature.
In ancient times the hologram was very different.
The global narrative was based on what the *gods* told us.
The cerebellum is the limiting factor for faith itself.
The master DNA creators incorporated the cerebellum into the DNA by adding a rung,
like creating a new organ,
so we would not progress beyond certain experiences and awaken to the fact we're farmed.
Our motor cortex used to be actively in alignment with our heart,
brain,
and gut.
Now the cerebellum is completely integrated into our heart-brain-gut complex and interacts as a medium with our reality keeping us in fight,
flight,
or freeze.
This is a catatonic state for consciousness expansion.
The cerebellum can hinder us from having astral travel experiences.
We can overwrite the cerebellum with heart based meditation.
This turns off the medulla oblongata.
A super highway between the brain and heart lights up.
This is natural for human beings.
