Q: In the case of an ALZHEIMER patient,
when they revert back to being a child,
what happens in their brain? Is that a form of Bilocation,
locality & nonlocality There is a breakdown of chemical memory association in the file tree.
This is where the skull cap,
top of the crown,
tells the spirit where all the files are stored inside the body.
The chemical memories are corrupting the file tree because the brain itself has broken down through lesions.
Cellular pathways that were originally created don’t have energy to support the brain.
There is a breakdown in the genetic journey as well as a part of the life & death contract.
A significant amount of distorted memory before going into the death process will trigger a very different form of life review.
When the patient reverts back to younger versions of the self it is a co-existence in time by technically bilocating in time.
It skews the light memories where the light body doesn’t identify to a single point of time anymore.
That is the corruption of the chemical memory,
part of the time stamping.
This disease can be contracted out in the foetus of the womb planning or DNA based.
There are certain DNA skinsuits with a prevalent experience in it and the foetus knows that before it goes into the DNA instrument experience.
There is loads we can do to prevent that but we don’t have the proper gut gnome from a very young age to support brain health.
Then there is the mental,
spiritual,
physical drama & trauma that attacks the brain even more.
The life journey can be cut radically short by the manipulation that was done to the DNA about 35,
000 years ago when they manipulated the brainstem itself,
where the motor cortex functions had an earlier ending date than the actual extended life process.
Many of us could live 200-300 years if we would have proper shamanic trauma resolution to not burn out the neuro pathways.
Optimal gut health is a precursor to avoid the plaque built up which causes diseases like Alzheimers.

The Instant healing exploration HARNESSING THE POWERS OF THE HOLOGRAPHIC BRAIN ON THE ORGANISM….
allows us to make the leap of faith and acknowledge that conscious is entangled and unentangled with the reality and the holographic model allows for both,
implicate and explicate order simultaneously.

Q: What are universal laws and what is their relationship to unentangled observers? Karmic Resolution,
Karmic Debt,
fundamental experiences that the varieties of the I AM share as the common experience of evolving as a being of light.
There are new laws that are being created all the time in other places and spaces but may or may not apply in our universe.
It is all about the volume of individuals who are part of the Ocean of Awareness choosing to experience a law as a fundamental value of experience from one to the next era of light.
Unentangled observers do not have to abide to universal laws.
That is the whole point of entering that state of neutral observation.

Q: You mention Egg & Sperm technology as one of the Universal Laws? Universal laws come down to egg & sperm technology or other birthing form technologies that generate DNA memories or lineages differently.
The birthing technologies determine how the universal laws are used differently and as such every birthing technology has different quantum laws.
The sperm,
seed,
egg technology allows access to the infinite blueprint or the planning stage.

Q: What is meant with Egg & Sperm technology?  Sexuality and Prayer are built into our DNA that this reality has given us to have coherent resonance with geometric holograms of information that we can decode,
process and use to our awareness advantages.
Procreational energy for non-procreation.
The journey into the greater awareness is understanding how to use your energy as a conscious being of choice.
We start in this bliss state where the infinite code is in the celestial mediumship.
The celestial medium steps down into the foetus and then goes through the laws of forgetting so it doesn’t have access to its infinite sight.
It then is a part of this hologram as a non-infinite being who is on the journey to celestial mediumship again.
We are forever trying to get back to that place of bliss and joy.
All the spiritual teachings since the dawn of spirituality have a bliss teaching.
Why? Because it is our fundamental part of our growth,
it is our birthright.
Inside that foetus of a womb state is that non-locality teaching.
We are both and what makes us any different than the foetus? The memories we have stored in light.
As a foetus,
in our blueprint we have the infinite set of memories and  potentialities we have created.
The actual linear and the non-linear memory creation is being processed as a being is going through all forms of awareness.
The I AM data unpacks and decodes of itself during different eras of its history.
Then we add the chemical memories which are there to enforce linear time so spiritual contracts of individuals in time can come to fruition.

There are beings,
that no longer use any form of birthing technology,
which are pure unentangled quantum observers.
Having said that they can use any seed and egg technology which then generates different forms of I AM technology and that’s how the 15 multidimensional beings were abusing the universal laws.
They knew that they could separate themselves into thousands of I AM experiences and remain the unentangled observer status in various degrees of separation because they were wholly unentangled,
conscious beings of energy alone using the laws of incarnation through technological means of interaction.
In the ancient past cloning technology was very easy to use.
They could easily incarnate into a dog,
a rabbit,
a cat and remain the unentangled observer.
The DNA instrument will also determine the richness of the experience of the unentangled observer.

Q: How would being a cat one lifetime impact on the DNA experience? By choosing to be a cat,
after having completed war related  contracts in the past,
she disconnected from the implicate order of repetitive karma which allowed her to have other lifetimes of incarnation separate of the karma that was created in the past.
By leaving the implicate and explicate order and becoming a completely unentangled observer in the natural food chain,
a separate karmic interaction,
beings of the past created debt that was put onto lineages.
The debt was no longer connected to that energy being but the lineage that they were in.
That’s how lineage based debt was created.
Using the unentangled observer technology not to be found out and use this agenda that allowed the karma to be nullified and not follow them through history.
Cats don’t usually take on the karma of genocidal humans or do they? They literally dodged their karmic responsibilities by leaving the chain of custody of karma which created the debt passed on to their future generations*
The double split experiment in modern physics demonstrates that light and matter can display characteristics of both classically defined waves and particles.

Q: What creates the interference that collapses the particles back into the wave and cancels them out? In the Ocean of Awareness,
which we also call THE LIVING ALGORITHM OF LIFE,
all the data is conscious.
You become the living Algorithm of life when you are in a DNA skinsuit that is regularly achieving near super or super illuminal thinking.
The algorithm is a fundamental part of the I AM technology unfolding as you grow older and become more experienced running the DNA skinsuit at its higher functionalities.

Q: What would be an example of becoming the living algorithm of life? When you act as the living algorithm of life,
with super illuminal thinking,
you can create a signature frequency where others can palpably sense the meaning of your delivery.
The nature of the anomaly,
AB,
him being fixed and not fixed in time.
In this refined state of beingness he enters the energy frequency that is the living algorithm of life and still stays grounded in his body explaining subject matters in the 26 letter encoded English alphabet.
We all can do it and probably won’t realise when we do it.
Often clarity comes in dream space,
when the mind is out of the way.
The celestial medium of peace is functioning in many scores of dreamworlds with many of the pre- and post cognitive workforces creating the language of masterful manifestations of visions.
The data as part of the wave form can ultimately work as the precognitive workforce to manipulate how the data will be perceived at its endpoint in space-time.
The ocean of awareness is the technical source point of the flow of data that may or may not generate into the sea of consciousness,
an observable time space reality.
It allows the data to flow to the sea of consciousness in a fixed time space narrative which then allows consciousness to observe it.
Consciousness in the sea of consciousness can both be entangled and unentangled,
manifested and non-manifested in time.
In the sea of consciousness quantum physics becomes confusing because you are still in the ocean of awareness and part of you might still consciously entangle with the ocean of awareness as a greater observer as space-time narrative.
This is how the ANGELIC FORCES WORK?
Let’s go back,
thousands of eras of light when the universe was not as big as it is now,
maybe 200 galaxies in it.
The Ocean of Awareness was a very small network then.
In order to get to know more about itself  and to make a Sea of Consciousness it generated a 7th dimensional galactic seed planet,
EARTH.
A place where the Ocean of Awareness can have direct manifestations,
change and adjust the laws of quantum physics,
entangled and unentangled observer.
There it could create matter based lifeforms on mass scales to begin to populate new galaxies as part of the greater exploration of where light can go into the void of experiences? Those lifeforms would go to the Ocean of Awareness to find meaning and to create agendas in the sea of consciousness.
Source can be observed as a hologram through the egg & sperm creation as all of the information is already there to form new parts of the hologram through experiencing new life.

Q: When talking about algorithms you also mention DATA? Data is a finished algorithm.
An ongoing algorithm is the conscious processing power CPU of the chemical memory being made into light memory.
In the journey of becoming a solidified chemical and light memory it becomes data.

Q: The journey of the algorithm is determined through time what does that mean? The observer ends the journey of processing the perception and turns it into a perspective before it moves on to the next subject matter.
We know 1+1=2 but when you are a little kid trying to figure out maths the brain slows down.
Once you have the answer that ends the process.
Having an affirmative answer it then becomes a solidified DNA memory in light (transcendence),
accessible through knowingness,
easily accessible to your awareness during pattern recognition.
There are times where the information is at the tip of your tongue but you can’t get it until the time you stop thinking about it.
The pattern recognition can trigger the memory from before.

LET’S TALK ABOUT FREE WILL,
CHOICE,
CONSCIOUSNESS & THE LEVELS OF AWARENESS
Q: How did the Global Narrative develop?
The global narrative as we know it today was created at the dawn of industrialization around 300 years ago so that electromagnetic belief engines would start overriding faith and become a programmed norm to live by.
This was necessary to get people to live in cities on a long term basis to use them as slave labour for industrial production lines.
Those slave generation after generation is what created and empowered the belief engine system.
Before that people used to live in their own bubbles of reality,
a few hundred kilometres apart with their own unique narrative by the chief or sheriff and the community council.
Many secret societies were created so that they could have their own narrative amongst their own followers and believers.
The global narrative knew that they needed to introduce trains,
automobiles,
,
electricity,
indoor plumbing,
hot and cold water refrigeration,
telephones and by around the 1920s people were living in wooden or stone,
brick houses that needed heating.
In a span of a little more than 120 to 130 years that rapidly expanded to have electricity in homes and they no longer needed to use whale fat and blubber for candles.
90% of the world was lit by the blubber industry for thousands of years.
That's the how big the shift was.
The narrative had to be updated,
revised and maintained from one generation to the next to suppress anything that wasn’t fitting into the official story,
down to hiding the findings of giant’s skulls and bones.
The enforcement and maintenance of the lies has been an ongoing theme until today.
I’ve said many times as long as we fight it we have already lost the battle.
It all comes down to the individual to make the global narrative irrelevant to the self and the greater process of awakening.
The desire to change the global narrative is the last part of the zealot rebel within us that wants to forcibly awaken everyone,
even the ones that aren't ready.
We can't force people to have an experience they're not ready for.
This is an individual awakening journey and not a global one.

Q: Who are we and what does it mean to have free will? We are photonic light beings with a non-localised soul empowering the DNA skinsuit to have consciousness in it that holographically perceives this reality in light and memories within these shared reality rules.
We are free willed encoded beings of light functioning in all kinds of different worlds.
Our world is based on a 100% free will planet,
universe,
galaxy,
solar system and the initial game plan that you co-created in the foetus can be changed at any time.
Everything is synchronistic with the celestial minds holding space for us.
This I AM being manifested in this density is mutually co-creating with our higher self and we are the boots on the ground in a localised space time event.
Our memories are stored in light and we share those memories within this hologram of light and sovereign space of power.
The heart is the first organ that develops in the mother’s womb and it is from this heart space we can learn to redefine our reality rules.

As I said earlier the plans we had at prebirth are plans or blueprints we can freely change.
Everyone has a belief,
that has a placebo around it,
that has past lives attached to it that gives us a foundation on how our shared reality rules work.
Everything is based off the perspective of the observer and as we untangle from personal and collective distortions of the many narrativs we can change all dogmas and perspectives that are limiting us.
Ten years ago the esoteric side in the global narrative tried to predict your future based on the data they have collected about you.
Nowadays they can barely predict 10-15 days as the governments are showing more and more of their dirty underwear and people become more conscious.
As a free willed being of choice you can change the bubble of reality you live in.
You can now start seeing the duality,
whereto and who to you had tacitly consented to before.
There is power in consciousness,
power in the scientific and spiritual exploration on equal footing.
This is not a global awakening but an individual awareness journey to get out of the heavily weaponised factions that challenge your own knowingness and hinder your birth right and legacy of being a free willed celestial being.
The future is resting in the free thinking people who understand the significance of getting back to the natural way of living.

Q: What is choice within the context of consciousness ? Consciousness expresses itself through the many choices we make.
It has an unconscious state too.
You bodies,
have an unknown side to the consciousness in which zeros and ones have been created as binary numbers for knowing and not knowing until the bodymindspirit as a complex being begins to generate an algorithm of decoding the information around you.
There are dimensions in thought,
densities of awareness,
densities of beingness too.
In the very beginning,
consciousness is choice equal to the level of responsibility of your awareness of your own consciousness.
Many people try to jump ahead and be responsible for things they are not aware yet.
Their mind gets bogged down with subject matters,
all these choices without knowing the implications of the choices they are making.

The most basic thing in consciousness is CHOICE.
In this holographic reality that is 100% free willed universe,
galaxy,
solar system,
100% free willed planet that has a surface above and below timeline you are choosing at every layer and scale of awareness your known and unknown side.

Each individual has their own view of what a choice or non-choice is.
Each person must ask themselves what are the mechanics behind my choices? What are the choices I have made that created a timeline of choices,
the chooser of choice points much adhere to? This may seem difficult to get but is the most basic form of self-understanding.
The timeline of choices you made to become a being of the now with the opportunity of the unlimited choice points.
Each choice and sub-choice within a set of choice points creates a subconscious map of adherence of choices that helps define our reality.
This reality is based on all of your choice points combined in the ever present moment of now.
Can you see the relation between choice and reality functions? If you can you can change the reality function in choice point order to manifest multiple choice point sets that override,
outcreate and disregard the previous sets of choice points if you so choose.


Q: What is the nature of Consciousness? We give form to consciousness through words and metaphors which can eventually turn into manifestations.
Those thought constructs create perceptions that can assist people to explore and begin to mindmap all the potentialities.

Let’s look at consciousness from a farming perspective for natural soul evolution in the celestial nurseries.
The background of the universe has lifeforms that exist in one and two dimensions and densities that become harvestable via wisdom,
love and inspiration expressed in a third dimensional density for further experience in the fourth and beyond.
You can breed feral consciousness in farms.
75% of the galaxy is elderly souls and 25% is new ones.
We continuously expand and add to the hologram through free willed creation.
Every era of light that we go through holds souls that leave and go to other universes and solar systems whilst new souls graduate from these celestial nurseries.
Yes,
the manipulated DNA farms are technically part of those nurseries albeit being farmed for commercial and not natural reasons.

That 75/25 percent ratio has been in existence for an extremely long period of time.
There are always new souls coming in from the different galactic life form nurseries.
They get a light body and then they need to extend their first set of contracts to a planet,
a solar system which determines the field of consciousness they start at.
Do they start in the Sea of Consciousness or the Ocean of Awareness? Is their first life experience as a human being living in a tunnel in South America two million years ago praying to a false god? This process is being replicated on millions of worlds for millions of different skinsuits as this is the nature of consciousness.
As it evolves we need to ask ourselves the question of what rights,
duties and responsibilities do we,
as consciousness incarnate,
have to use our intention and attention to create direct manifestations to add to the holographic experiences?
Q: What is consciousness in its most basic form? Right now there are different levels of background consciousness around you.
Take the house you live in as having its own relative consciousness from the building material,
the wood,
the concrete it is made of.
The people that invested their consciousness in building it,
the trees that surround it,
the property itself,
the piece of land that you are on including all the micro organisms around you as well as squirrels,
cats and dogs.
All of those have a conscious field of energy,
with their specific spiritual contracts,
guides and guardians; an apparatus and infrastructure that allows ascension and descension through the different individual layers of dreaming experiences.
This animated matter we are entangling with is part of the fabric of the hologram,
linked and dynamically transformed through the interaction between human and microorganisms.

Q: What would define consciousness as spiritual to have a greater awareness of itself? Consciousness is intrinsically spiritual but there is a marker point of a natural belief a caveman may have versus an evolved belief of a caveman having applied shamanic practices.
Part of spirituality is to acknowledge and become aware of other consciousness surrounding,
interacting and sharing with us.
You can be on your own in the house and still have that experience of consciousness sharing and entangling with you.
You are never truly alone.

Q: Can we say consciousness is an evolutionary impulse within all of us to grow and advance? DNA can be its own evolutionary impulse that influences consciousness to move when experiencing stagnant energy.
Memories which make up part of 80% in our DNA can trigger that stimulus as well as the part of the DNA that corresponds to our spiritual codes and contracts that entangles with consciousness to allow purpose and mission to unfold in linear and none-linear time.

Q: What is PLANETARY & UNIVERSAL CONSCIOUSNESS? Seeing the planet as a waveform and we are the subcarriers within that wave? There is a master waveform that is operating at a much longer length of time and within that waveform are all the individual subcarriers,
or observers,
of that era or light or time.
The celestial mind is operating on a much longer and expansive view of time and timelessness.

THE LEVELS OF AWARENESS
1.
THE OCEAN OF AWARENESS &mdash; THE UNIVERSAL HOLOGRAM
The consciousness outside of time we can call it the OCEAN OF AWARENESS - THE UNIVERSAL HOLOGRAM -  that has the individual universal experience within.
The universal experience will become a microbeing on a celestial planet that chooses forgetfulness to become finite as part of a universal evolving experience.
We can call that the AVATAR which operates as many I AMs inside and outside of time.
The consciousness flow in the Ocean of Awareness allows the data to go from wave to particle,
the celestial medium to the DNA experience.
The Ocean of Awareness is the implicate order.
There are different Oceans of Awareness in other universes,
many implicate orders,
as every universe creates different agendas,
experiences,
incarnations and reincarnations.
Not every universe uses incarnation,
many don’t use I AMness as technology like ours with seed and egg technology.

Q: How does The Ocean of Awareness work fit into the quantum theory? The  Ocean of Awareness is part of the intricate waveform quantum physics refers to.
Through different levels of awareness it can be collapsed into particles as well as every particle can again be broken down into subpoints of observation.
The particle can be one DNA lineage and all DNA lineages simultaneously based off what we choose to observe through it.
The Ocean of awareness generates one particle which is technically the whole hologram but we perceive the hologram at different skills of awareness.
So the particle can be tens of millions of lineages and tens of billions of worlds.
An individual observer works up the scale of observation that says: I am in this lineage that is this particle on this planet but it is also part of a solar system which makes it a bigger particle so on and so forth.
Our local hologram is one particle and we are particles inside that one particle.
As individual particles we can perceive the next particle &mdash; the solar system particle.
That’s what I call a solar system cork screwing through time.

Q: What does ‘A SOLAR SYSTEM IS CORK SCREWING THROUGH TIME’ mean? which is on a galactic groove,
so your local star system of galactic time,
or your local star system of time is one particle.
We as conscious beings of awareness and choice can go to the next scale,
where the solar system as a particle is one part of a giant galactic particle.
This then gives us access to the grand ocean of awareness through conscious entanglement with it.
There we have the ONENESS concept.

Q: Can you give an example on when we are working with The Ocean of Awareness? When you are doing the GOLDEN TUBE OF CONNECTION teaching &mdash; connecting from the body to the sun you are achieving the solar system particle awareness.
That’s why you connect to the sun on the other side of the tube and allow yourself to pulsate back and forth.
The sun is the portal into the next form of awareness &mdash; THE CELESTIAL COMMERCE MARKET AGAIN…
In the DRAGON REVOCATION we talk about going beyond our sources light.
We can go to other Oceans of Awareness that are technically still entangled with our Universal Ocean of Awareness through aunt and uncle lineages of sources.
Many sources have divested into different ways of experiencing.

2.
THE SEA OF CONSCIOUSNESS &mdash; THE TIME SPACE HOLOGRAM
One scale lower is the SEA OF CONSCIOUSNESS - THE TIME SPACE HOLOGRAM -  that allows you to incarnate into a gender of NARRATIVE TIME (COLLECTIVE CS) &mdash; bodies for unique experiences that amplify the ocean of awareness to rediscover itself as one.
In this SEA OF CONSCIOUSNESS you can have more than one avatar as you can be thousands of beings and being in thousands of places and spaces forward and backwards throughout all time space,
history and universe.
You have to see it like a giant network pattern of choice operating at a much wider timescale versus a shorter timescale.
The hologram is the time space equation.
It is the particle,
from the quantum physics perspective.
The particle is everything and nothing at the same time.
It can be implicate and explicate depending on the perspective of the observer.

3.
THE MULTIVERSE
THE   MULTIVERSE contains The Ocean of Awareness & Sea of Consciousness and hereby contains 17 universes interacting with each other,
creating the 18th in which karma will no longer be used as a debt based system.
All debt goes to the 18th universe of creation and we will have a collective of prime creators,
a council of many different sources running that new universe.
It starts with one galaxy and the Earth is the portal to this new universe.
High frequency consciousness created that first galaxy.
DIAGRAM
Q: What are the AKASHIC RECORDS?
The Akashic Record are the cellular memory of the Earth.
They are a recording of all sentient existence on this planet,
in the above,
middle and the below timeline.
These records are stored in the crystalline layers of the earth that starts in the core of our planet.

Each layer of the Akashic Record,
records the sentient’s race’s existence.
There is also a crystalline network of mineral people and crystal people,
that are spread between every layer of rock,
and every layer of rock represents a different layer of the Akashic Record.
The actual Akashic Record literally records every past,
present and into the future lives,
because Earth is the anchor of all sentient projections into this reality.


Q: Could we call it the cellular memory of our earth? Yes,
there is a crust under the dirt layer of our planet and within the granite there is 60 to 75 % crystalline matter that serves as a data storage unit and a co-creative interactive spiritual exchange of history.
Everything that happens on this earth is being stored.
Each planet in this solar system has their own version of Akashic Records.

Q: How do the AKASHIC RECORDS link with quantum theory?  The AKASHIC RECORDS can be likened to the implicate order As it is all about allowing mental morphology coming into a greater view.
The Akashic Records are also an explicate order as they are an ongoing picture.

Q: What is the purpose of those records? The Earth is a Dreamtime reality with many layers above and below it,
so it is able to maintain the record of all vibratory beings,
who choose to come into this experiential reality.
It helps them understand their life review process in the astral worlds,
and what they have been doing in this world.

Earth is also linked to many other worlds that are brother and sister worlds,
so it can link itself to the other Akashic Records of other Dream Worlds,
so that beings here for this grand experience,
can understand the totality of their being.


Q: What determines what is being recorded in the Akash? The soul of the planet determines what is being recorded in the A.
R.
If you picture a brain and a skull cap around it,
the data is stored in the skull cap and the brain is the processing unit of the information.
It is the sum total of all experiences of the planet as a celestial mind,
a dreaming mind connected to the crystal structure.
The oldest records are near the core where the records are stored in the crystalline veins.
It can take days to tap into and solidify the information.
You can take your record with you,
downloaded into the light body DNA,
with an exact copy what it did here,
to analyse and study what you did.
Every single sentient experience in this world is stored there in the sacred neutral perspective.


Q: How and why does one read those records? The Akashic Records can anticipate your presence and most readers go into some form of trance,
to combine their past,
present and future soul shards to read them.
North and South Pole hold our dreamtime memories as a marker stone for truth in order for us to connect with your past and your future,
your star brothers and sisters as a personal direction to accomplish a complete life.


Q: How does DNA interact with the Akashic Records?  DNA,
the 80% memories,
and the Akashic Records are intimately and intrinsically a part of each other.
The experience the skinsuit has gets encoded into light frequencies that represent RNA and DNA strands,
photonic light given form which is the encryption and decryption algorithm.
Consciousness is the decryption algorithm and the DNA itself is the encryption of light codes.

Q: What types of Akashic Records are there?
-        Your local Akashic Records on your planet
-        Your Solar System Akashic Records
-        Your Galactic Akashic Records
-        Your Universal Akashic Records
-        Your Collective Universal Akashic Records
There was a time before Akashic Records too when our universe was more in a non-free will state at that particular point.

Q: How do you AB,
work with the Akash?.
