Q: What does ‘A SOLAR SYSTEM IS CORK SCREWING THROUGH TIME’ mean? which is on a galactic groove,
so our local star system of galactic time,
or our local star system of time is one particle.
We as conscious beings of awareness and choice can go to the next scale,
where the solar system as a particle is one part of a giant galactic particle.
This then gives us access to the grand ocean of awareness through conscious entanglement with it.
There we have the oneness concept.

THE SEA OF CONSCIOUSNESS &mdash; THE time-space HOLOGRAM
One scale lower is the SEA OF CONSCIOUSNESS - THE time-space HOLOGRAM -  that allows you to incarnate into a gender of NARRATIVE TIME (COLLECTIVE CS) &mdash; bodies for unique experiences that amplify the ocean of awareness to rediscover itself as one.
In this SEA OF CONSCIOUSNESS you can have more than one avatar as you can be thousands of beings and being in thousands of places and spaces forward and backwards throughout all time-space,
history and universe.
You have to see it like a giant network pattern of choice operating at a much wider timescale versus a shorter timescale.
The hologram is the time-space equation.
It is the particle,
from the quantum physics perspective.
The particle is everything and nothing at the same time.
It can be implicate and explicate depending on the perspective of the observer.

THE MULTIVERSE
THE   MULTIVERSE contains The ocean of awareness & Sea of Consciousness and hereby contains 17 universes interacting with each other,
creating the 18th in which karma will no longer be used as a debt based system.
All debt goes to the 18th universe of creation and we will have a collective of prime creators,
a council of many different sources running that new universe.
It starts with one galaxy and the Earth is the portal to this new universe.
High frequency consciousness created that first galaxy.

Q: What are the AKASHIC RECORDS?
The Akashic Record are the cellular memory of the Earth.
They are a recording of all sentient existence on this planet,
in the above,
middle and the below timeline.
These records are stored in the crystalline layers of the earth that starts in the core of our planet.

Each layer of the Akashic Record,
records the sentient’s race’s existence.
There is also a crystalline network of mineral people and crystal people,
that are spread between every layer of rock,
and every layer of rock represents a different layer of the Akashic Record.
The actual Akashic Record literally records every past,
present and into the future lives,
because Earth is the anchor of all sentient projections into this reality.


Q: Could we call it the cellular memory of our earth? Yes,
there is a crust under the dirt layer of our planet and within the granite there is 60 to 75 % crystalline matter that serves as a data storage unit and a co-creative interactive spiritual exchange of history.
Everything that happens on this earth is being stored.
Each planet in this solar system has their own version of Akashic Records.

Q: How do the AKASHIC RECORDS link with quantum theory?  The AKASHIC RECORDS can be likened to the implicate order As it is all about allowing mental morphology coming into a greater view.
The Akashic Records are also an explicate order as they are an ongoing picture.

Q: What is the purpose of those records? The Earth is a Dreamtime reality with many layers above and below it,
so it is able to maintain the record of all vibratory beings,
who choose to come into this experiential reality.
It helps them understand their life review process in the astral worlds,
and what they have been doing in this world.

Earth is also linked to many other worlds that are brother and sister worlds,
so it can link itself to the other Akashic Records of other Dream Worlds,
so that beings here for this grand experience,
can understand the totality of their being.


Q: What determines what is being recorded in the Akash? The soul of the planet determines what is being recorded in the A.
R.
If you picture a brain and a skull cap around it,
the data is stored in the skull cap and the brain is the processing unit of the information.
It is the sum total of all experiences of the planet as a celestial mind,
a dreaming mind connected to the crystal structure.
The oldest records are near the core where the records are stored in the crystalline veins.
It can take days to tap into and solidify the information.
You can take our record with you,
downloaded into the light body DNA,
with an exact copy what it did here,
to analyse and study what you did.
Every single sentient experience in this world is stored there in the sacred neutral perspective.


Q: How and why does one read those records? The Akashic Records can anticipate our presence and most readers go into some form of trance,
to combine their past,
present and future soul shards to read them.
North and South Pole hold our dreamtime memories as a marker stone for truth in order for us to connect with our past and our future,
our star brothers and sisters as a personal direction to accomplish a complete life.


Q: How does DNA interact with the Akashic Records?  DNA,
the 80% memories,
and the Akashic Records are intimately and intrinsically a part of each other.
The experience the skinsuit has gets encoded into light frequencies that represent RNA and DNA strands,
photonic light given form which is the encryption and decryption algorithm.
Consciousness is the decryption algorithm and the DNA itself is the encryption of light codes.
