## Agencies


We use *I am* agencies here as a metaphor to explain the subject matter.
Agencies are made from energies of existences outside of time and the *I am*.
The *I am* is finite in time.
Those energies still entangle us in this lifetime.
Those agencies are not always operating at the highest standards and practices comparable to the precognitive workforce.
We  can have a contract resolvable only in high frequency.
We have to work with low quality agencies to resolve karma.
We can terminate cooperation with an agency and agents outside agencies.
Culture is an external factor that influences the themes of agencies and agents.
For example,
the agency is our first point of contact when we are a fetus in the womb.
Together with our higher self it is responsible for creating all spiritual contracts for this lifetime.
The employer of the agency is is,
the human,
the *I am* of this lifetime.
The employees
&mdash;
agents of the agency
&mdash;
are the various pre *I ams* who represent the many expressions of us in the unseen.
They don't always work in unison and sometimes try to take over the agency.
The us of today was once a fetus in our mother’s womb.
The fetus knows it needs a variety of experiences to plan infinite potentials.
It works hand in hand with the agency to make a series of contracts which fit our karmic resolution.

It's possible another fetus in another womb is you as well.
Our soul is far too big to just fit into one DNA body.
Simultaneous bodies as part of our soul expression is common.
The more efficient the agency works,
the more often we reuse it through our many fetus plans.
Some of them are low quality agencies.
They can mess up the matching of our *I am*.
Often an agent has worked with several other *I ams* and has a good working relationship and reputation.

The fetus comes through the birthing canal and enters the great forgetting.
The child starts unfolding its own awareness around two years old.
It's no longer directly working with the first point of contact in the agency alone.
The *I am* baby is settling into the new DNA skinsuit and is learning from the parents and the environment.
As babies we have full access to the vagus nerve which means we are still connected to the mystical side of this existence at a larger level.


The vagus nerve is like a control room.
It operates the body with its special skills.
The *I am* is housed in the vagus nerve with access to the entire consciousness DNA experience machine.
As the *I am* gets older,
it works with different levels of authority within the agency.
Often at puberty the *I am* fires the existing agency.
Why?
The *I am* says:
*I have to be a sovereign being in this lifetime and as such I need to take back my sovereignty from all these I ams represented by the agencies*.
Most of it happens subconsciously.
The level of hormones drive us during puberty.
The *I am* apex presence here and now has the power to boot out other *I ams* if they are trying to run the agenda through the *I am* apex by corrupt agencies or soul families.
Agencies can also be shared by soul families.

A bankrupt *I am* is someone who gave up the responsibility of creating their reality.
They handed over authority to the programs and former *I ams*.
It could be a person in a post life review who chose not to cross over right away and hung around as a temporary ghost.
This creates a longer form of shadowing and fractalized soul shards.
When finally crossing over the *I am* no longer has a point of contact to assist with the life review and future fetus planning.
There are times when a living person has become a bankrupt *I am* or has given all authority away.




The *I am* apex has the power to out-create itself.
An *I am* at any point can go into the vagus nerve and begin the journey of self- mastery,
self-healing,
self-nurturing,
and kick out the negative programs that are in there.
There are times when we give authority to a protective part of us,
a program,
a self-created demon.
It takes the authority.
It says,
*I get to work with the agencies you don’t*.
It doesn’t give us any indication,
no memo or email.
When bad things happen in our lives we are usually not in our *I am*.
We're not fully in our body and vagus nerve.
They're not in the driver seat.
False synchronicities can be created when an *I am* has too many soul shards in them.
The soul shards begin to take over the *I am* spot in the vagus nerve.
They contract with the actual agency in unawareness of the *I am* that has made the original contracts.
In order to step back into the mighty *I am* apex it takes daily practice,
courage,
and determination.
We must continue the work of self-mastery without the neediness of instant gratification and external validation.

Agencies can work in multiple time space equations.
Agents inside the agency are certified to work in time and no time.
Some agents work with other non-certified agents of other time space equations for the purpose of forcing a match no matter how minute it is.
Agents and the agency are separate entities.
Think of them as independent contractors who are contracted by an agency to do the work.
Some agents are full time employees and some are outsourced contractors,
akin to when a bank sells a product and bets against what they're selling you.
Even though the *karmic resolution machine* has run its course,
we as beings are still attempting to reincorporate our fractured selves,
our traumatized and charged perspectives.
This allows the agencies to use those traumatic experiences as a perspective for matching us to let go of karma and work towards dharma.

The agencies contracted out in the womb are still working with us in the now.
As long as domination and control still exist,
where we are forced to accept tens of millions of layers seen and unseen,
we will be dealing with agencies and contracted agents of agencies who have three degrees of separation from the responsibility of the destruction they cause for someone who is not equal to the level of awareness during this time of awakening.

The *I ams* working against us can be resolved with contract revocations,
shamanic work,
and daily practice of self-mastery.
We all have parts of us that work for the domination and control agency.
We have *I ams* that work for thousands of different agencies throughout the universe.
High level shamanic work is getting rid of the one star agencies to only start working with the five star agencies.
Low level agencies have a very low standard of signature frequency match.
Higher quality agencies have higher standards of match making.
The agency is here to help you write a contract on the fly.
That is best resolution for all sides.
Low level agencies look for lower levels of resolution to get their quota.
