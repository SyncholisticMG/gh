## Entities and Demons


A program may or may not be consciously entangled.
It all depends on how life force empowered the program is.
The more we are out of our body,
letting the program run us,
the more it's entangled with our vagus nerve.
The vagus nerve gives it access to our special skills.
It creates confusion about what is the soul and what is the program.
Some people’s bodies are controlled and run by programs.
They take over the vagus nerve.
The *I am* is unaware.
Once programs take over the we are susceptible to entity association.
Entities can take over the programs.
Karma determines the growth and veracity of actions entities take when they take over programs.
Entities might not know they're being run by karma.
It is easy to get lost between what is internally created and what is external entities.

Ninety-nine percent of entities are self-created.
One percent is bonafide haunting.
Not everyone is meant to work with entities.
There's an intuitive factor to knowing what to work with.
If we don’t have the intuitive factor built in we should not be in that realm.
It's curiosity learning.
It happens when we let the programs run us.
When we are curious about something we are not the neutral observer.
Curiosity itself has a charge and polarity.
We are controlling a subject matter.
It's right at the edge of the unknown.
The brain fills in the unknown before it's known.
People want to know and are falsely drawn to it by paranoia.
It's a vibration in them saying,
*I need to know about entities so they don’t invade me*.
They might not have had any around for months,
but the curiosity draws them.

There are certain forms of energy we might confuse as an entity.
They're just shards of us.
They initially were part of the story we created,
then they turned into internal programs when the story was empowered by charge and polarity.
A trauma can develop from a scary story.
It doesn't really affect us or turn into full blown fear,
anxiety,
or paranoia.
We can go back to the original story we over-created,
see the tree of creation for what it really is,
and release the trauma.
A lot of people need help to get back to that source.
Not everyone can do it on their own.
Certain people with ancestral DNA switches turned on don't have the capacity for that self-inquiry.


There are times when the story is so strong the entity takes over the life-force and the person finds it impossible to disentangle.
As healers we have to slow down.
We shouldn't go beyond the match of our vibration.
The house always wins.
You never know what's next when people are possessed.
We are the alpha entity,
but self-defeating habit patterns make our potential a low match to high vibration.
Getting out of shame,
blame,
and guilt is the beginning of the healing journey.



When we are speak to someone run by an entity we usually talk to both.
We speak to them and the entity simultaneously because the person is both an entangled and unentangled observer in that scenario.
Make the entity come out to a conversational match so we can speak to it.
The client can be a fully unentangled observer listening to you talking to the entity even though he or she is using her vocal cords to respond to its thoughts.

When people work with very low quality agencies to create,
they often use us as a signature frequency match to get others into their web.
They find it difficult to be on their own or need instant gratification and constant validation for their ideas and creations.
As a healer or teacher we will see that a lot of people falsely match themselves with you.
When we know it is a false match,
we can use it to our advantage and not create karma.
Depending on the power of our vibration,
if  potent enough,
their alter ego has to retreat and their *I am* can feel the vibration.
The altered ego is usually a chicken shit.
When the *I am* has to defend its actions,
it shows us how misaligned with its own sovereignty it really is.
We have to maintain a high vibration not to let chaos define the key notes.

Shattered shards of *I ams* are either bankrupt or fractalized *I ams* unauthorized to deal with an agency but still take on this responsibility without our authority.
We all come across these forms during the healing and teaching journey.
Take someone who has been sexually abused at a young age who uses an altered ego to protect themselves emotionally.
Then they go through healing,
and they no longer need that shard,
or,
they use chemical drugs and create more shards,
demons,
vigilantes falsely protecting them.

An external demon is a life force that has not crossed over.
It maintains itself as a surface bound energy spirit,
draining life force from others.
It cannot produce its own light.
It could be an *I am* that didn’t want to pass over,
or an off-world being that could live thousands of years but lost its capacity to maintain a single body.
Its *I am* can create new bodies temporarily,
but the vibration of this world doesn't allow these bodies to stay in existence long.
This is why it possesses other bodies.

An internal demon is the result of intense trauma.
The story becomes so big that the character goes into the vagus nerve and the subconscious empowers it to be the potent being,
then it becomes the dictator,
tyrant,
and abuser through addictions,
self-defeating habits,
and self-sabotaging mutilations.
The person’s internal demons try to dominate and control the external demons.
External demons often run as the internal demons can be very strong and destructive.

An implanted entity is a powerful demon that has thousands of ways harvesting energies off you.
They control many minion demons much younger under their hierarchy.
It's well documented in CS Lewis's *The Screwtape Letters*.
It will implant into you,
and its job is to pretend to be your inner higher voice until you won’t be able to distinguish what is your voice and what is the demon’s voice.

An explanted entity is something that has been put inside you to create a signature frequency match and then purposely ripped out to create a drama.
Once outside of you it still vibrates on your frequency,
serving as a bait line to lead you down a track of false synchronicities to negative external sources.

Inculcated entities are advanced puppetry
&mdash;
you don’t know who or what is pulling the strings
&mdash;
a very old external demon source with lines into thousands of minions feeding up the tree.

A clone has a spark of the person in it.
The spark has a similar spiritual contract pattern to the original being.
It's against sovereign free will rules to collect an entity’s DNA and make a clone of it.
Cloning against someone’s free will creates a person that is dominated and controlled with little or no sovereignty.
This would enable other sentients to take over the body at any point.
The vast majority of the worlds trade beings genetically built with a suit for consciousness to broadcast from one planet to another.
That suit can be inhabited for a period of time and then put into cold storage for later use,
or they unmanifest the body,
travel energetically to a planet,
and manifest a body there.


Running into a fully depressed person can be tiring.
It's important to know when you speak to the person or a program,
an internal demon.
When the person is in the body,
the programs are shut off.
Sometimes external entities can still come in.
There are people with powerful external or internal entities in them who are subjugated.
We can hear it in their voice
&mdash;
how meek they are.
There is no power in their voice.
