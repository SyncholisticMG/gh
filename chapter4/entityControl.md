## Entity Control


A program may or may not be consciously entangled.
It all depends on how life force empowered the program is.
The more we are out of our body,
letting the program run us,
the more it's entangled with our vagus nerve.
The vagus nerve gives it access to our special skills.
It creates confusion about what is the soul and what is the program.
Some people’s bodies are controlled and run by programs.
They take over the vagus nerve.
The *I am* is unaware.
Once programs take over the we are susceptible to entity association.
Entities can take over the programs.
Karma determines the growth and veracity of actions entities take when they take over programs.
Entities might not know they're being run by karma.
It is easy to get lost between what is internally created and what is external entities.

Ninety-nine percent of entities are self-created.
One percent is bonafide haunting.
Not everyone is meant to work with entities.
There's an intuitive factor to knowing what to work with.
If we don’t have the intuitive factor built in we should not be in that realm.
It's curiosity learning.
It happens when we let the programs run us.
When we are curious about something we are not the neutral observer.
Curiosity itself has a charge and polarity.
We are controlling a subject matter.
It's right at the edge of the unknown.
The brain fills in the unknown before it's known.
People want to know and are falsely drawn to it by paranoia.
It's a vibration in them saying,
*I need to know about entities so they don’t invade me*.
They might not have had any around for months,
but the curiosity draws them.

There are certain forms of energy we might confuse as an entity.
They're just shards of us.
They initially were part of the story we created,
then they turned into internal programs when the story was empowered by charge and polarity.
A trauma can develop from a scary story.
It doesn't really affect us or turn into full blown fear,
anxiety,
or paranoia.
We can go back to the original story we over-created,
see the tree of creation for what it really is,
and release the trauma.
A lot of people need help to get back to that source.
Not everyone can do it on their own.
Certain people with ancestral DNA switches turned on don't have the capacity for that self-inquiry.


There are times when the story is so strong the entity takes over the life-force and the person finds it impossible to disentangle.
As healers we have to slow down.
We shouldn't go beyond the match of our vibration.
The house always wins.
You never know what's next when people are possessed.
We are the alpha entity,
but self-defeating habit patterns make our potential a low match to high vibration.
Getting out of shame,
blame,
and guilt is the beginning of the healing journey.
