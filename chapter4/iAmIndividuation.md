## The I am Individuation Process



Time is irreversible.
There's is no linearity to it.
Energy is indestructible.
Every moment within a time-space equation creates an energetic imprint that cannot be erased.
No two physical objects occupy space simultaneously.
There is no simultaneous or identical history as they follow a unique light path.
We are a standing sine wave of existence as the *I am* apex in embodiment now,
in resonance or dissonance with our previous and future source streams.
The quantum hologram carries the complete history of each energetic imprint of all source streams within this time line paradox.


We have mighty *I am* selves in the past where we were an extremely powerful energy being compared to what we are now.
As part of karmic resolution we gave away our *I am* self sovereignty to conduct timeline recovery operations.
Those ancient *I ams* plus another forty to fifty *I am* selves spread all over timelines and dimensions are still making decisions that can alter our present choices.
This is one reason why so many people are unsuccessful in this present world.
When we have two or more present selves making choices in a free will universe.
One choice contradicts the other.
We cancel ourselves out at the co-creator level.
There is another level of paradox in which we have one present self on a high energy earth,
and another present self on a very low energy earth.
One can easily dominate from high or low energy.
Reclaiming our sovereignty reclaims our authority from all high energy versions of ourselves in competition and hierarchy.
It removes our citizenship from all involved organizations.
All our shards,
parts,
and avatars can leapfrog forward in time and claim unity consciousness to remedy all paradoxes.


When we transit timelines we must figure out which is the optimal for us.
It can also be involuntary.
We could call this a form of harvesting.
We can get deliberately thrown off our timeline,
or we can have chunks taken out of us and put into different timelines.
This sounds fanciful,
but remember,
our DNA is technology.
Entire ancestral lineages are being harvested like this for eons of time.

A point comes when the harvesting ends.
We must make a final choice to be here and now with our friends and family.
A scenario like this would be planned pre-birth.
It is often facilitated through a traumatic experience in this lifetime.
It gets us to the time line we need to be on.
A good way of working through such traumas and dramas is to look at a photo album.
Get in touch with the us at the various stages of our lives.
Bring memories to the surface and look for pattern recognition.
People are often born onto the wrong timeline.
The soul knows it.
It has to go through trials and tribulations to get back to where it needs to be.
The dreaming body
&mdash;
the main time traveling technology for us
&mdash;
facilitates those changes.




The mighty *I am* apex presence co-creating self has come into this world now as a representation of all our sentient selves which incarnated into this world before with decision making power for all the celestial minds of our past,
present,
and future lives.
Only the ever present mighty *I am* self in the now can make choices in co-creation with the unity consciousness world.
In other words the *I am* apex presence of the now is the ultimate choice mechanism of this lifetime.
Other aspects of our self can provide the information upon which we make choices.
The ever presence is literally all of our other selves in dominion with the *I am* presence now resolving contracts with soul family,
soul planets,
or whatever else we are experiencing in this reality.
We,
as the *I am* apex presence,
are deeply honored by all the ancestors because we are in an ongoing co-creation with the world to expand consciousness as a global community of transformers and consciousness explorers.

The essence of this universe is free will of the *I am* presence now.
The soul and higher self are included but the higher self does not get to make choices only the *I am* presence does here and now.
The higher self can counsel but it can’t give us the questions,
only the answers.
When our history is eliminated it puts us in the paradox of paradoxes.
We don’t understand who we truly are.
We may not even have any questions to ask.
This is often an indication that there are parts of ourselves making decisions for us without us involved.
Those paradoxes can be forty or fifty *I ams* at the time working on destruction rather evolution.
We can’t destroy other *I ams* but we can work with them.
We can heal them or we can ban them through our free will choices and actions within the authority as this *I am* apex presence of the now.


We are already the higher self.
The *I am* is here in time,
as constructed by the higher self during womb planning,
and the higher self is holographically interacting with you at all times.
The *I am* here and now is based off several previous *I am* selves who have gone through life reviews and set up a theme of karma or dharma for this lifetime.
In the first five years or so we fully activate our *I am* technology.
The rest of the *I am* comes in during puberty.
Our higher self remains the sacred neutral observer throughout all our incarnations.
When we die we meet our higher self again as ten thousand past and future generations of other selves.
The *I am* is the technology of interface with the god source already in us.
We have to learn to get to know ourselves as the embodied spiritual human to understand our soul’s purpose and missions.
