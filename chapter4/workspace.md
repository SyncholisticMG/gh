The Schumann resonance is background frequency of electromagnetics that is effected by solar winds and radiation,
the actual magnetics of the planet.
It represents an opportunity for consciousness to rapidly expand.
If you feel that you respond to the spikes it might say to you that you have all this electromagnetic thinking juice and you are not doing anything with it.
The Schumann resonance is not one number.
It is many,
like a team dance combination.
There is no one common shared Schumann resonance around the world.
All of them make up the orchestra of consciousness.
Sometimes you have many orchestras playing different interpretations of the classics and at times other playing remixes.
Mountains,
lakes,
deserts and rivers alter the Schumann resonance as well as the seen and unseen life in those areas.
Think of the Schumann resonance as the key musicians playing.
Through consciousness you are quantumly entangling with the Schumann resonance.
Working with our *I am* agencies is a choice in awareness or unawareness or both.
The Schumann resonance determines the veracity of interaction or speed signs and at times has nothing to do with Schumann rates.
It’s the key that allows things to act in synchronicity,
false or real,
so that best matching actions,
seen and unseen,
create powerful manifestations.
The quality of the agency will determine the power level and the time of action in a key.
Our modern light-worker community has bastardized the Schumann resonance into something that it is not.
Idiots with youtube PHDs trying to hypnotize something into an absolute truth.
The Schumann resonance is there to keep all living things seen and unseen on one celestial musical key.
Free will allows us to explore many keys that can create resonance with the natural way of living or not.
A dissonant state is the cacophony of chaos and chaos is its own universal key.

Q: What is the difference between Consciousness entanglement and a program?
A program may or may not be consciously entangled.
It all depends on how life force empowered the program is.
The more we are out of our body and letting the program run us the more it is entangled with our vagus nerve .
The vagus nerve gives it access to our special skills which often creates a confusion of what is the soul and what is the program.
Some people’s bodies are controlled and run by programs that have taken over the vagus nerve and the *I am* has no idea.
Karma determines the growth and veracity of actions entities take when they take over programs.
At times entities don't know they are being run by karma.
It is easy to get lost between what is an internally created and what is external entity.

Q:  What are entities and how do we work with them?
99% of all entities are self created with about 1% being external haunting.
NOT EVERYONE IS MEANT TO WORK WITH ENTITIES and that is why classification can be not always helpful.
There is an intuitive factor to knowing to what to work with and what not.
If you don’t have that intuitive factor built in you should not be in that realm.
That is what I call CURIOSITY LEARNING.
When you let the programs run you.
When you are curious about something you are not the neutral observer because you have already charge and polarity out of curiosity itself.
We are controlling a subject matter,
which is right at the edge of the unknown that the brain is going to fill in the unknown before it is known.
Lots of people think they have to know and then they are falsely drawn to it via paranoia.
It is the vibration in them saying I need to know about entities so they don’t invade me whilst they might not have had any around for months.

Not everything is an entity! There are certain forms of energy that we define as an entity that have never been one,
they are just shards or parts of us.
They initially were simply part of the story that we created before they turned into internal programs when the story became empowered through charge and polarity.
A trauma can develop from just being a scary story,
that does not really effect you,
into fully blown fear,
anxiety and paranoia.
Trauma release can be where you go back to the original story that we over created and seeing the tree of creation for what it really is.
This is where many people require external help to get back to that source.
Not everyone can do that on their own.
There are certain people that have ancestral DNA switches turned on and don't have a capacity for that type of self-inquiry.
They would do well with DNA surgery or taking DNA surgery classes,
extended DNA surgery journeys to work on the strands of consciousness that are limited.

There are times where the story becomes so strong,
the entity takes over the life-force and the person finds it impossible to disentangle.
The next wave of healers needs to come out where their frequency,
vibration and harmony is enough to erode those stories.
As one of those healers you’ve got to slow down.
Don’t go beyond the match of your vibration.
Remember,
the house always wins and you never know what is next when people are being possessed.
Yes,
you are the alpha entity but self-defeating habit patterns can make your potential a low match to high vibration.
Getting out of shame,
blame and guilt is the beginning of the healing journey.

When you are speaking to a client that is run by an entity you usually talk to both.
We are speaking to the client and the entity simultaneously because the person is both an entangled and unentangled observer in that scenario.
When I say speaking to the entity,
your plan of conduct is to make the entity come out to a conversational match so you can speak to it.
The client can be a fully unentangled observer listening to you talking to the entity even though he or she is using her vocal cords to respond to its thoughts.

Q: What does it mean when people are forcing their SIGNATURE FREQUENCIES onto you?
! This is when people work with very low quality agencies to create.
They often use you as a match to get others into their web as they find it difficult to  be on their own or need instant gratification and constant validation for their ideas and creations.
As a healer or teacher you will see that a lot of people faux match themselves with you.
I immediately sense when this happens and it helps me understand if my teaching will make a difference or not.
This is part of knowing who you work with and what is required for the person to hear and for me to say or not to say.
With that approach I can assist them making memories but they can still be bastardised and altered by their ego.
I go to extreme levels of spiritual strategy to deweaponise scenarios like that.
When you know it is a  faux match you can use it to your advantage that does not create karma.
Depending on the power of your vibration,
if  potent enough,
their alter ego has to retreat and their *I am* can feel the vibration.
The altered ego is usually a chicken shit.
WHEN THE *I am* HAS TO DEFEND ITS ACTIONS IT SHOWS YOU HOW UNSOVEREIGN IT REALLY IS.
We have to maintain a high vibration not to let chaos define the key notes.

Q: What are shattered shards of IAMs?
These are either bankrupt or fractionalised *I ams* that are not authorised to deal with an agency but still take on this responsibility without your authority.
We all come across these forms during the healing and teaching journey.
Take someone who has been sexually abused at a young age using an altered ego to protect themselves emotionally.
Then they go through healing and they no longer need that shard or they use chemical,
drugs and create more shards,
demons,
vigilantes falsely protecting them.

Q: What is an external demon?
It is a lifeforce that has not crossed over and maintains itself as a surface bound energy spirit draining off  lifeforce from others as it cannot produce its own light.
It could be an *I am* that didn’t want to pass over or an offworld being that could live thousands of years but lost its capacity maintaining a single body.
Its *I am* can create new bodies temporarily but the vibration of this world does not allow these bodies to stay in existence long enough and that is why it uses other bodies in a parasitic format.

Q: What is an Internal demon?
In general an internal demon is a result of intense trauma and drama.
The story becomes so big that that character goes into the vagus nerve and the subconscious empowers it to be the potent being.
Then it becomes the dictator,
tyrant and abuser through addictions,
self-defeating habits,
self-sabotaging mutilations.
The person’s internal demons will try to dominate and control the external demons because of that person not validating the abuse.
External demons  often do a runner as the internal demons can be very strong and destructive.

Q: What is an implanted entity?
It is a powerful demon that has thousands of ways harvesting energies off you,
controls many sub minion demons that are much younger under the hierarchy of a more powerful demon.
It will implant into you and its job is to pretend to be your inner higher voice until you won’t be able to distinguish what is your voice and what is the demon’s voice.

Q: What is an explanted entity?
Something that has been put inside you to create a signature frequency match and then purposely has been ripped out to create a drama.
Once outside of you it will still vibrate on your frequency serving as a bait to lead you down a track of false synchronicities to negative external sources.

Q: What is an Inculcated entities?
That’s what I call advanced puppetry – you don’t know who or what is pulling the strings – a very old external demon source that has lines into thousands of minions that are feeding up the tree.

Q: What is a clone?
When you create a clone of a person,
you have to have a spark of that person in the clone that has a similar spiritual contract pattern to it.
It is against sovereign free will rules to collect an entity’s DNA and make a clone of it.
Cloning against someone’s free will creates a person that is dominated and controlled with little to no sovereignty.
This would enable other sentients to take over the body at any point.
The vast majority of the worlds trade beings genetically built with a suit for consciousness to broadcast from one planet to another.
That suit can be inhabited for a period of time and then put into cold storage for further later use or they unmanifest the body,
travel energetically to a planet and re-manifest a body there.

Q: How do you deal with people who are run by entities in a session?
*I am* asking myself what choices in the now will they make?
Are they going to lie or avoid the questions as their truth.
If they choose to tell the truth and be authentic even in their lies then we have to start unravelling their programs.
*I am* not battling the programs.
*I am* giving the soul an opportunity to step into the body to stop the programs arguing for their limitations.
THIS IS ME FLIPPING THE FREQUENCY on the person so the program loses its power.
This usually works for kicking out entities.
Running into a fully depressed person can be tiring and it is important to know the difference when you speak to the person or a program,
an internal demon.
Now,
when the person is in the body,
the programs are shut off,
sometimes external entities can still come in.
At that point I can out vibrate the energy by being fully present but it can still come back another time.
This is when I do the REPEAT AFTER ME PROCESS,
where *I am* getting them to acknowledge the trauma that was there,
dissolving the fake signature frequency match that it is using to be inside them.
Oftentimes the entity is repeating the words as it doesn’t know what *I am* making it do and I can get the entity to pass on out of its own language.
As the client or caller goes into emotional release there is the process,
communication between the caller and the entity as the house of cards falls down.

There are people with powerful external or internal entities in them they have become subjugated to.
We can hear it in their voice how meek they are.
There is no power in their voice and by the end of the session the voice has changed.
These callers coming into their bodies and *I am* reseeding the natural sympathetic and parasympathetic coding by the *I am* coming back into the vagus nerve so that it doesn’t dominate them and it can trigger emotional release which is often stopping people,
they can’t have an emotional release.

At other times their celestial medium is fully speaking to that person and they have fingers in their ears etc.
They may be perceiving the communication but they are not getting anything.
Their higher soul is getting a message of how to recalibrate its process as that person’s fetus in the womb’s blueprint does not have enough foundational pieces for them to make that manifestation of the original infinite blueprint.
*I am* giving an updated code to the higher self on how to make it happen in the framework of this memory that is there for that person during this frequency of time for them to do something with it.
That is soul surgery.
Linguistic alchemy.

Q: How does one make sure that the person does not invite the entity back in?
We can’t ensure that and it will be down to the persons choices.
It is part of the follow up,
emphasising the importance of daily practice,
sacred neutral perspective,
self-healing and mastery to consistently raise and maintain their frequency so that the memory is going to stick to keep the entity out.
I have an understanding that the experience itself is going to create a memory,
are they going to bastardise it or not,
that’s a different story.
Some people have such destructive habitual patterns as well as rebels that just refuse to conform with any changes.
Being a rebel might have been vital to get out of the soul family they weren’t supposed to be in and now it is working against them as they are not committing to themselves by being overly identified with their rebel persona.

Q: What is psychic soul surgery?
That is the super illuminal me,
using conscious aware Andrew talking and the super illuminal experience to travel to spaces,
timestreams,
dimensions,
galaxies and universes where shards are locked out of the frequency of the being.
My voice is creating a portal for them to return and the many precognitive mes are preparing and healing the shards so  they can go back and re-integrate into their fractional.
There is obviously body language that goes with that.
There are times where individual pieces and codes are being pulled out and cannot be brought back to the body as they are too negative,
as part of the reintegration phase.
We have seen me use my hands to  separate data.
I don’t need to do the hand language but it makes it a lot easier for me talking to you as *I am* making the body part of the experience.
The body has more CPU power so I can do it show after show.
I have my own prepared space and energy for that and the super illuminal capacity of my thought power can bring in all the energies that are needed and prepare the shards.
There are certain shards where I have to talk the person through to get them back in,
that’s that repeat after me process,
because they have to consciously bring it in.
I can only bring those shards to the edge of their aura and if they don’t want them I have to take them back.
