## Psychic Abilities


Empathy is the lowest class of observational skill sets.
Remote viewing is described by Ed Dames and the people that originally brought it out.
There are many different modalities of remote viewing.
Some are advanced and some simplistic.
Remote viewing can be a perception at the lower levels of psychic expression,
or there is clairvoyance,
clairaudience,
clairsentience,
which are all much higher experiences that you may have in a remote viewing session.

There are many forms of psychic expression and growth.
One of the more colorful characters of our generation in psychic lore is Uri Geller.
He was born in Tel Aviv in 1946 and raised in London.
His signature trick is bending spoons.
The bald kid in the Oracle's apartment when Neo visits in *The Matrix* is a nod to Geller.
There's much more to Geller than that,
though.
He was clairvoyant,
a remote viewer,
and employed by the oil and gas industry to find oil and gold.
Can you imagine?
It's a hint at the corporate foray into magic and rituals
&mdash;
using clairvoyants to locate resources.
Most people would laugh in your face if you told them such things
&mdash;
and much more
&mdash;
went on in the irrational halls of the corporate world.
Uri made boatloads of money.
He found natural resources all over the world.
As a dowser he didn't use any rods,
only his hands and intuition.
He could mark oil resources on a map as he flew over land.

He brought out the idea that clairvoyance could be employed in an open market.
American and European corporations arenâ€™t big on psychic skill sets.
Every major business meeting in China in which contracts are negotiated and signed has the executives,
the signatories,
flanked by psychics
&mdash;
readers,
energy cleaners,
lie detectors,
and other skills.
There are freelance psychics hired by companies.
They have skill sets to understand the negotiating patterns of the person in front of them.
There is not a single contract in Hong Kong or China signed without psychic approval.
It's is a very ancient tradition and business practice.
They are also a lunar people.
Their moon calendar influences their decision making immensely.

What made Uri Geller so different was his spiritual contracts were in a modern age with modern media.
He was the first psychic superstar since the Elizabethan mystics,
John Dee and the Enochian magic crew.
Uri was hit by a laser beam from an orb in a field at the age of five,
he became activated to develop his skills.
He trusted his skills without doubt or hesitation.
Synchronicities lined up.
They were arranged through his fetus of the womb blueprint.
It's fair to say he was a highly notable person in ancient times,
lifetimes of notability in whatever subject matter he focused.
His energy was easily recognizable.
It allowed for grand spiritual contracts of recognition through media.
He inspired millions of people to go and look at their esoteric,
spiritual,
and psychic journey.
He showed the world a deeper understanding of consciousness.
It forever created attacks against him.
Even after leaving the public stage,
detractors are still trying to defame and debunk him.
He was and remains real.
There's much more off-stage.
Geller found his path and mission,
but he could just as easily been picked up by Mossad or MI6 and exploited for patriotic duty.
The relationship between intelligence,
military,
and the occult is a favorite topic of the conspiracy crowd,
but,
nonetheless,
it's true,
and,
what's more,
it's always been true.
Why the West has been so dumbed down in consciousness is a treatise in itself.
Suffice it to say we're in the tight grip of a dark force.
Enemies just made Geller more popular,
enough to jump generations.
Uri Geller is an example of capabilities.
Almost anyone can be trained in such a manner if they have discipline and courage.
It's not not mystical.
Mystical is related to God,
the prime creator.
Our consciousness abilities are there for us to develop.
Pretending they don't exist is the single greatest conceit of Western consciousness.
