## The Senses


Human beings alive today have explored perhaps fifteen percent of their taste spectrum.
We can taste light,
but we donâ€™t know how.
We have forgotten.
We don't need it to survive anymore.
There aren't many naturally occurring toxins in the mega city,
aside from the cities themselves.
Our taste was a defense mechanism.
The subtleties of our palettes is astounding.
Two hundred years ago naturally living people could taste rain to come in the air.
We can still do it.
We've just forgotten.


Humans are limited in our sense of smell.
A dog can smell kilometers away.
A black bear can smell much better than a hound dog.
We have psychic scent.
The nerves for smell go through the third eye
&mdash;
the rods and cones.
Our third eye is a concatenation of all our senses.
The sense of smell is linked to deep memory.
We can recognize smells from previous lives.

The sense of sight is a concatenation of ears,
nose,
tongue,
and center of gravity.
Gravity allows us a sense of touch through our body when we're in motion.
It creates gyroscopic effects throughout our chakra systems.
Gifted children can read a book by putting their hand on it.
This is the time in which were are.
There is a flowering of the genome,
the founder genes pushing through the global narrative.
Our sight is intrinsically linked to the rest of our senses.
It can perceive touch as much as it can perceive scent,
taste,
and sound.
Our eyes hear because hearing is an integral part of speaking.
A person that has been deaf their whole life can feel the vibrations of their voice which makes up their language system.
Their eyes feel the vibration as much as their nose and their tongue and the rest of their body.
