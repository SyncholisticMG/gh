## Sigils and Glyphs

The geometric patterns and shapes used in Hellenic Science are holographic activations.
We can see the fabric of reality as a sigil.
The sigil is a symbol of power.
Not all sigils contain the same potency and power.
Hellenic Science has amassed a bunch of potent sigils with mythological power behind them.
Previous generations have used them as a daily prayer and belief process.
This is the basis of the power.
We are the root of all the power,
human beings and our powerful but co-opted consciousness.
Even though cultures perish their myth energy is still behind them.
It's suspended in the hologram,
waiting for us to connect with it.


Time and space are not real.
The hologram and the sigils never truly lose power.
They are forever gaining power.
They hold our attention and extract our intention.
A glyph is different than a sigil,
more personalized,
with an expression behind it.
We can have a unique kind of catalyst.
When we have several layers of data to sense and process without competition before reach a milestone in our journey.
It's our birth right and legacy.
Practice gets us there.
The obstacles are distractions,
the Maya and karma wanting to couple with us in low consciousness.
Don't rely on external sources,
or allow curiosity learning to drive your journey.
Put your mind to what you want to achieve.
Add time and enthusiastic effort.
Our awareness of hidden treasures will change.
Keep the pleasure factor.
Life is meant to be pleasurable.
As the Greeks said,
all things in moderation including moderation.
There are no rules.
When we feel it we want it.
When we want it we strive.
This is how the sacred journey begins.
We sense a hidden rapture in the fabric of reality and we set about to find it.
The seeker is an incarnation class,
a graduating class.
Once you begin a thread forms between incarnations and more consciousness and spiritual purpose are aspects of our incarnations.
Stay joyful,
connected to living in this world.
Don't allow spiritual things and spirituality to drain your social skills.
Blend it all together.
We don't have to go to caves to do this.
Donâ€™t ever limit ourselves.
Have courage in our convictions.
Control is self-deception.
Our learning unfolds how it's supposed to unfold.
