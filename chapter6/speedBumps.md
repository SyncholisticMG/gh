## Speed Bumps


People are forced into bilocation all the time.
They just don't realize it because it isnâ€™t what they think it is.
This is a tremendous insight into many of the mysteries of consciousness.
Many times we are already doing something but lack the contextual understanding.
Think of our dormant abilities like languages we don't speak.
We can hear the language but not understand it,
therefore we tune it out,
but it never goes away.
The same is true of our higher receptions in consciousness.
They're there.
We just tune them out.
Premodern cultures shared dream time.
Their lives and culture was internal and external.
We all share dream time,
but it has been blocked,
hijacked,
disturbed in the mega cities.
Energy speed bumps in our environment can kick us out of our bodies and bilocate us.

Energetic speed bumps occur naturally everywhere on our planet.
The negatives of our world supercharge our speed bumps.
No matter our speed the bump puts us into a major up and down motion affecting our energetic field.
Imagine walking through a mega mall in Christmas season.
Negative energies set up speed bumps every five to ten steps.
It's how they harvest our energy.
They're not there to pick our pocket.
Every time we walk into a store and we see a sign that says Sale,
Two for One,
or Seventy Percent Off,
it's an energetic speed bump.
It slows us down.
We pay attention to what's on sale.
A parking lot that keeps us looking for a space is a speed bump slowing us down.
It frustrates us as a means of energy harvest.
Realize our value as spiritual equity.
Seen and unseen economies exist around our energy.
It's best to conceptualize it as an ecosystem.
Our simplest energies,
but especially our emotions,
and especially emotions enamored with an intention.
Most systems of worship that have reached cultural and national expression are pure harvesting systems.
Be wary of contracts in religious life.
The only promise that can ever be fulfilled in religious contract is the promise we make to ourselves to make our journey.
