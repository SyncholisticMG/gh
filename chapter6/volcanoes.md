## Volcanoes


The Mount St. Helens eruption was one thousand six-hundred times more forceful than Hiroshima.
The power behind it was astounding.
The Krakatoa volcano in Indonesia exploded in 1883.
It was so loud everyone in the world could hear it.
Gigantic dust particles were put into the air.
The energy produced by volcanic eruptions is harvested by off world technology.
It's quite easy for them.
Inside the  volcanic cloud is pure static electricity/
It's destructive to living sentient beings.
The pure energy can be absorbed into the off-world vessels just by their being in the cloud.
It's as as simple and natural as a homesteader harvesting rainwater.
UFOs routinely enter and leave our clouds.
It often looks like they're shooting beams of energy into the volcano.
When the volcano settles lava tubes are created.
The lava tubes provide access to deep underground sites.
The volcanic explosions create pure energy.
Some people are attracted to the energy.
They have spiritual contracts to live by the volcano and experience regular spikes of super high frequency.
