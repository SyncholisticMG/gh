## Gold and Silver

Earth has more gold than we can use.
There is gold everywhere.
There are positive ways to mine gold.
We're using gold for the wrong purpose.
Ninety percent is for industrial use and only ten percent for recreation.
Think about that.
Gold is meant to be available to all of us.
There is a reason why the Mayans adored all the walls with gold.
It amplifies our frequencies.
We can imprint messages into gold through carvings or molding figurines.
We create prayer spaces that can absorb holograms with gold.
Imagine a ton of gold lining the inside of a house,
all corners and walls,
the ceiling and floor.
It's going to amplify the frequency of the home no matter what we do in it.
Our clarity can be increased by as much as eighty percent.
Anything that has an electromagnetic frequency has high clarity through being in contact with gold.
Gold allows electricity to move through circuits faster.
Anything set up like circuitry
&mdash;
DNA or the way stones are aligned
&mdash;
will increase the flow.
We have gold inside our bodies,
inside the general body system,
our chemical makeup.
We can naturally transmute and make gold inside our bodies at any moment in time.

Silver is a natural antiviral,
antibiotic element that kills the microorganisms around you.
People use colloidal silver.
There is colloidal gold,
too.
It can be directly absorbed into the body.


When we take the imprint out of the gold,
it's still precious gold.
Whatever myth or history is impressed into an element or metal is part of a mutual co-creation.
Pure gold is a form of technology.
It amplifies a being’s consciousness in unawareness or awareness,
depending on their level of belief.
Churches are full of gold layered walls and objects,
which is a different way of projecting.
Some attribute moments of frequency increase to religious experiences.
In reality,
it's created through the common thought structure and the elemental interaction of gold as high frequency catalyst.
Hundreds of thousands of species have used gold to amplify frequencies.
It's very common throughout the universe.
Egyptians,
Mayans,
all of the ancient people,
really,
coated everything in gold to increase the frequency.
Pyramid structures are frequency amplifiers,
too.
The Giza Pyramid is big.
Anything within ninety kilometers or so is going to be affected by its frequency.
It's a way to put circuitry to spirituality,
divest its energy,
harvest it,
then redirect it through the pyramid structure.

Lining a room with gold would be for a very specific type of personality and practitioner,
beings that are powerful projectors and then even more powerful receivers.
A clairvoyant or clairsentient being in a golden room would exponentially increase a remote viewing experience.
The next super level up is receiving information.
The practitioners project themselves to a different location with high forms of clarity.
Other people in the room see them as a generated hologram.
We could have one to four people go out to observe,
and ten to twenty people see the holograms that are being generated around them.
Add silver and copper to the gold in the room and we would have high forms of kinetic control capacities.
A human being can learn to manipulate vibration and kinetic energy by touching a wall and feeling the vibration in it.
The entire pyramid is a vibrational structure,
meant to harvest vibration deep from the planet and then center that vibration in its structure to create a powerful resonator.
When a human being knows how to kinetically control they can resonate with stones and make them float as if they were weightless.
By adding silver and copper to gold,
we can change the elemental nature and capacity.
We can tap into the background frequencies in the field around us and direct energy towards technology for direct absorbance.
This capacity is built into the human skin suit.
This is why we can go to founder technology places,
or other super high technology worlds.




Silver has many uses.
If we had a bed made solely of silver,
a lattice network of micro silver fibers,
it would be very powerful,
like a box spring,
but super compressed,
we dream deeper and enter delta frequencies.
We could add a variety of other elements and crystals to it to help create affinities to certain realms.
The imprinted view of scarcity of gold and silver is part of the manipulation used in the global narrative.

Copper filters particles to be energized.
A magnet's magnetic field could be seen through metal shavings on a piece of paper close to the magnet.
There are some magnetic shavings that take more exposure to become magnetized.
Some non-ferrous things can be magnetized by intensifying the field through the use of copper.
Copper in its natural environment is generally not in a rock shape.
It has crystal,
silver,
gold,
additional water,
and one or two additional types of elements around it acting as a massive amplifier of the actual background energy.

Copper in coil form can be used under the bed to negate toxic energies like the curry lines.
In past days people knew how to manipulate the curry lines in such a way that it was very beneficial to the earth.
The stone circles that are all over the African desert,
documented brilliantly by Michael Tellinger,
are examples of circuitry.
The Hartman Curry line circuitry created a very effective way of literally harvesting the surface or the energy for many uses.
They built hospitals,
work houses,
and schools being able to read the energy of what was right for the place.

Atomic weapons are made out of plutonium.
Plutonium can be found deep under the ground everywhere,
and it creates a negative frequency when it becomes very dense.
Plutonium as a background element is radioactive and has a long life.
The radioactivity is not unhealthy for human beings.
It can charge the energy and make it move at the plutonium decay rate.
Plutonium can overwrite bio-electric circuitry.
That is the nature of the radiation.
If you take plutonium from its original deep surface radiating source and expose it to the sun,
the high desert,
for example,
its radioactivity would begin to reflect that of the sun and become a very potent energy generating and regenerating life forms.
It's possible to create gigantic life growing farms with water in high deserts and transmuted plutonium through sunlight.
It's used for nuclear weapons,
in batteries,
and many of other things.
Low levels won’t hurt us.



Titanium is a biological entity that goes through an evolutionary completion before it becomes titanium.
The way strands align themselves when observed under a specialized DNA microscope is a semi-helix circle pattern.
Titanium can be melded with many other types of metals and mega titanium,
which is a specialized titanium alloy with unique properties to it.
It's used to replace steel as it's so strong.
One inch of steel equals an eighth inch of titanium in strength.
It is also used for drill bits in dentistry.
Titanium can be bonded with other alloys for antennas.
A cell tower made of pure titanium a thousand feet in the air would produce energy to harvest.
Titanium allows torsion,
twisting,
and bending without breaking.
It's extremely weather resistant.
Install it anywhere in the world and create five-hundred times more energy than a solar or wind driven turbine.
It can mix with human beings too.
Solidified titanium can be liquefied to use electromagnetic energy as its network of absorption through the actual its energy pool.
This could instantly be solidified as armor around a being without inhibiting mobility.
It can turn into technology,
an exosuit that instantly adapts to any environment.


These technologies will be used when we get out to other worlds as consciousness explorers.
It will be an entirely new education journey of changing environments,
leaving the planet and living on ships for extended periods of time to acclimatize to the radically different frequencies of other planets.
They have tests to determine if we're going to have a harsh reaction to a specific planet or not.
So we will know where to go.
Other species do this as well as the Secret Space Program on this planet.
We have around four thousand three-hundred bases outside of our solar system inhabited by one-hundred and eighty billion human beings harvested off our world since 1830.

If you are harvesting raw electricity Iridium can be very useful.
It's a hard day gauge and you can produce crucibles,
very heat resistant containers in which metals or other substances can be melted.
While Iridium is very rare here on earth it's all over the galaxy and solar system.

Palladium continues to give mystery to the rest of the universe.
Palladium is worth more than gold.
Palladium is the most valuable of the four precious metals with an acute shortage here on Earth driving prices up to record levels.
The usage is increasing as governments,
especially China,
has tightened the regulations,
the crack down on pollution from vehicles,
forcing us to increase the amount of precious metals we use.
Palladium has very unique energy factors.
It doesn't allow anything to live on its surface and kills all microorganisms by catalyzing the environment.
It keeps energy moving very fast before slowing down.
We can imagine the beneficial impact on technology and jewelry.



There is a structure to all metals,
part of the coding.
We don't yet understand the fullness of the coding.
What does it mean to have those metals in our environment.
How do we entangle with them as a hologram,
make them a part of us.
These codes can be likened to the soul coding in our DNA.
The elements have their own version of coding.
There's a common code and structure to those elements that allow us to turn them on as biological entities.
If our DNA has a biological consciousness,
a resonant frequency inside it,
we have one of the many codes to activate it as a natural living being.
Those elements are beneficial to us,
and they should be in all of our background frequencies and energies,
walls,
bricks,
houses,
roadways,
elevators,
community centers.
The lack of information and use is part of the system of domination and control keeping our DNA capacities dumbed down.
All the geometric structures and codes found in nature,
in our DNA,
and in those elements allow us to interact,
access,
activate,
and directly interface with each other.
