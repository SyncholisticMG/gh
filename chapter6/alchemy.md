## ALCHEMY ABC 123

Our DNA instruments
&mdash;
our bodies
&mdash;
are quantumly entangled with everything around us:
elements of nature,
precious metals,
minerals and compounds in the earth’s crust.
We can influence the weather equal to the weather's influence upon us.
Everything is in constant creation
&mdash;
egg and sperm,
two cells meet and become linked to create new life.
The alchemy of creation,
elemental amalgamation of DNA unraveling a code of growth through individuated biological life forms.
Alchemy allows the many different states of being to be in a chemical and spiritual makeup to manifest.
It is a way of experiencing some of those higher skill sets before we can generate them without the need of alchemy.
Imagine a volcanic flow,
gold and silver meeting a crystal pocket that starts to cool and then generates precious elemental veins.
The transformation process is natural,
an alchemical process beyond human hesitation and doubt.
One man’s trash is another man’s treasure
&mdash;
treasure being something precious,
something that can catalyze greater awareness and growth.
Treasure gives us pleasure.
It can make us wealthy,
and it can curse us.




When we go to the edge of the unknown we must leave all expectations behind.
The deep internal experience is objective.
The subtlest of impulse energies can corrupt the reception.
We must be purely receptive.
The receptive state is appreciative.
It's longing.
It's gratitude for the longing.
Ask
&mdash;
*where is this inquiry going to lead me?
Is it going to contribute to my life?
What do I want to create with it?*
Maintain a curious mind out of charge and polarity.
Curiosity is not always innocent.
It can create false attachments and disturbing outcomes.
Pornography can start as an innocent journey and turn the other way very quickly.
There are plenty of subject matters related to violence.
They drain life force.
Curiosity can lead us down the wrong path.
Remain vigilant against any internal or external programs or incoherent energies not in alignment with what we want to create.



Start with a curious mind.
Put a stop to endless seeking when things go awry.
Curiosity ends and active learning begins.
If you're serious about being on this awakening journey you won’t get away with curiosity learning.
Your emanation will not be authentic.
People will eventually see through your superficial emulations and walk away.
Curiosity has been weaponized.
It keeps us in a state of curious searching versus genuine learning and growing.
When we move beyond curiosity we bring more spirit in.
We turn off misidentified empathy.
We turn on intuition and allow clairvoyance,
clairaudience,
and clairsentience to be part of our experience.
