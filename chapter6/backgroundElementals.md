## Background Elementals

Background elementals are interlinked particles,
part of the ocean of awareness without individuation,
not yet formed into animated consciousness.
We don't have any literature on them in the esoteric record.
The term itself is appointed here.
Extremely rare background elementals exist on earth and other planets.
They could be a potent contribution to our lives.
They are not yet available to us as a consciousness interaction.
How the earth,
and we as human beings on the earth,
interact with these elements in our environment is as astounding as everything else in the spiritual economy.
Every planet has a different crystalline layer,
and each is a unique piezoelectric field.
The right mixture of elemental compounds embedded with crystals on a planet is called the slurry.
There are planets where gold is very rare.
A planet with less gold resources doesn't have a naturally high electromagnetic cycle.
Electromagnetic waves from the solar system are constant,
solar flares for example.
The planet retains them for a period of time.
They assist in an evolutionary process  which is different for each planet.

Oxygen in our air is not pure.
It’s a mix of oxygen,
nitrogen,
carbon monoxide,
water,
and other parts,
all influenced by the global weather patterns on macro and micro scales.
The same is true for oxygen inside lakes,
rivers,
and puddles.
Through entanglement with weather patterns we're being subjected to changes.
A shelter keeps us protected even though the weather rages outside.
It effects us inside the house through pressure.
Water is blended with oxygen in the air we breath.


Oxygen is the basis of life on earth.
There are planets with no oxygen.
Life can exist in the rolling particles of dust.
The dust creates its own electromagnetic field.
Willows of the whisk,
or other things floating around in the bogs and marshes,
produce gases associated to electromagnetic frequency.
When these gases reach a certain layer just above the dew point they come together on the etheric level and become a temporary elemental intelligence.
It resolves after accomplishing its mission.
For example one form of this intelligence would stir up stagnate energy in places and space.
Another elemental intelligence can help beings that have crossed over to find their tunnel of light or assisting in the seed process of growing microorganisms deep in the ground.

Elementals take their instructions from the celestial mind of the planet and the caretakers of each specific realm.
We can break our planet down into eight thousand and six-hundred realms.
Each realm has its own independent time and specific purpose with different types of elemental entities and background rules.
Elementals have enough intelligence to accomplish their tasks,
and to know if they're working outside their mission.
The eight thousand and six-hundred realms span over the surface timeline only.
There are separate realms akin to counties inside the hollow earth.
These realms don't store information from the akashic.
The akashic records are still in the North and South Poles in the Aurora Borealis.
This is technically where their access point location is for the hubs of interconnectivity,
even though we can access the akashic records from anywhere on the planet.
These temporary elemental intelligences are like the earth’s antibodies.
They make grids and patterns which create ancestor resolution and ancestral procreation on the lands.
They clean up toxic energies if something goes into extinction and there's no surface lineage left to do the work.
Elementals don't take a straight line to get to their resolution because they have a *wandering* energy.
