## Water

Water is programmable.
As we learn to imprint on water we can give energy to the oceans.
We can acknowledge all ocean species and marine life.
We're at a time where we can do great healing to all sentience on the planet.
We are that majestic.
The ocean flows through its tidal mechanics.
It's a waking dream meditation on the ebb and flow of energies in our reality.
We can use the tidal energy to for intense releases.
We can create with it.
Focus our awareness with full intent and presence to the intensity of the energy.
On the way out allow all our distractions to flow out.
Use the potency of the ocean for masterful manifestation.
Give the water our voice.
The water will carry our voice to the full length and depth of its volume,
and to all the tributaries,
rivers,
lakes,
and deep aquifers throughout the world.
Water can carry our voice.
Acknowledge all ocean life in the prayer process,
the ocean itself,
its life force.
Sync with the tidal motion.
Confirm your feelings for the programmed water.
We experience a whole new dimension of understanding.
Water is the most valid history on the planet.
It bears witness to all.
It's literally the record of things at an elemental level.

Our planet has had its water stolen over hundreds of generations.
Global disasters have been planned and executed to redistribute the ancient water.
It was imprinted by high dimensional beings whose purpose was to protect the earth.
The catastrophes sought the deepest water in the earth
&mdash;
the primal water deep in the earth
&mdash;
and brought it to the surface.
They reprogrammed the water with false light technology.
Water has been taken off the planet by the trillions of gallons.
It's planted on other worlds.
Earth's water is replaced with polluted water from another planet.
The earth is used to  cleanse it and clear its karma.
That's right
&mdash;
we've been used as a galactic water filter.
It's the height of abuse and indignity.
What chance does our system have for evolution if we're used a drive-by laundry for bad karma.

There's a race of beings on the planet who live in the oceans.
The Merfolk community holds the records of those thefts and dirty water dumps.
Water is a rarefied commodity.
It's more valuable than anything else on the planet.
There are countless water discovery projects on earth at any given time.
There are groups on the surface into it,
and there are inner earth races also looking for the reserves of the ancient programmed water.
Our deep water reserves were programmed by the founders.
Are you starting the get what's going on here?
The commerce,
the human traffic,
both physical and astral,
the larger web of commerce that is a galaxy
&mdash;
we're sitting at a poker table semi-consciously,
not realizing we're the mark among players who make the barest placation to any notion of free will.
But it's changing.
The Nietzsche adage that anything which does not kill us makes us stronger is about to take on a whole new meaning in the twenty-first century,
if for no other reason than the facade of death is going to pass from the human experience.
It's part of the limited consciousness manipulation that has been going on here for too long to say aloud.
Immortality begins by realizing the body is only a state of being.
