## Language as Time

Lots of people reject word learning.
The school system leaves trauma imprints.
All the information,
all the data,
all the capacities and skills are within us.
We lack the context to apply language.
It's so limiting.
The significant structural components of grammars delimit time
&mdash;
past,
present,
future
&mdash;
and then deeper into time potentiates,
past,
present,
and future perfect.
The point is clear.
Language is time.
Subject acts against object in time.
It's the human condition reduced to a simple linguistic principle.
We,
the human beings
&mdash;
the subject
&mdash;
act upon the object
&mdash;
the world.
We want to see our effect upon time and outcome.
We're exploring this third dimensional space.
This is the principle of learning in a free will world.
