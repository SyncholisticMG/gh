## Floods and Hurricanes

Electromagnetic frequencies are created in a flood.
The water strips electrons from the surface as it moves.
This increases the speed of the water.
A dam break creates rapid flow of water.
Tidal energy rolls into the shores of the world.
Hurricanes push the water inland,
as do Tsunamis.
They're both rapid releases of electromagnetic energy.
All these occurrences have wisdom and bring treasures.
On the unseen side negative entities get swept away.
Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans was a massive purge of five centuries of ghosts.
The city was never the same after Katrina.
The ghost communities had figured out how to harvest the land and the people.
The energetics of the hurricane destroyed their psycho-spiritual ecosystem,
their economy.
