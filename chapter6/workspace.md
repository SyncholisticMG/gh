## Language as Time

Lots of people reject word learning.
The school system leaves trauma imprints.
All the information,
all the data,
all the capacities and skills are within us.
We lack the context to apply language.
It's so limiting.
The significant structural components of grammars delimit time
&mdash;
past,
present,
future
&mdash;
and then deeper into time potentiates,
past,
present,
and future perfect.
The point is clear.
Language is time.
Subject acts against object in time.
It's the human condition reduced to a simple linguistic principle.
We,
the human beings
&mdash;
the subject
&mdash;
act upon the object
&mdash;
the world.
We want to see our effect upon time and outcome.
We're exploring this third dimensional space.
This is the principle of learning in a free will world.



Q: Nurturing our hidden treasures through catalysation instead of waiting for activation? In order to use our DNA instrument to the fullest capacity and tap into our skills we need to stop giving away our core energy.
Instead of preserving and tapping into our own energy source connection we keep using the background,
radioactive radio electromagnetic frequencies to stay motivated.
This will not assist us if we want to continue on the path of exploration and consistent evolutionary growth.
There comes a point where the living algorithm of life transcends into the ocean of consciousness.
It is no longer an algorithm but an emanation of light in a collective of other emanations of light that are sharing a flicker frequency.
We are not an equation,
we are not just binary numbers,
we are so much more than that.
This is also why the fractured world view between science,
cosmology,
spirituality does not work as they don't look from a unified,
holistic perspective of who we actually are and how we are interacting with our environment,
on this planet and beyond.

Our environment does not activate us by itself.
We can use external sources as a catalyst to get us understand that we are the spark solely responsible to fuel our inner journey.
We use external factors to help us solidify growth situations.
Let’s take Hellenic Science as an example.
When it comes to the geometric patterns and shapes that are used in Hellenic Science these are holographic activations because you can see the fabric of reality as a sidual,
a symbol of power.
Not all siduals contain the same potency and power but Hellenic Science has amassed a bunch of very potent siduals that have mythological power behind them,
meaning that previous generations have used them as their daily prayer and belief process.
Even though those cultures no longer exist today their myth energy is still behind them,
suspended in the hologram waiting for us to connect to it.
Time and space are not real and therefore the hologram and the siduals never truly lose power.
They are forever gaining potency and power the more they are observed as a sidual or holographic geometry.
You can go into a grand master doodling state and allow sacred symbols and glyphs of power to be created.
A glyph is different to a sidual.
A glyph is more personalised with an expression behind it to have a unique kind of catalysation as a form of experience.
Once you allow yourself to have several layers of sensing and processing data without any of them competing with each other internally you have reached a major identifying marker in time.
This kind of multidimensional expression is our birth right and legacy.
The journey to get there is practice.
The more multiple aspects of your journey you practice the more new perspectives you gain to see how multidimensional reality can work for you.

Don't rely on external sources or allow curiosity learning drive your process.
Put your mind to what you want to achieve,
add time and enthusiastic effort and your awareness of your hidden treasures will change and increase through diligent application.
Keep the pleasure factor and stay joyfully connected to living in this world not allowing spiritual things and spirituality to drain off your social skills.
Don’t ever limit yourself,
have the courage of your convictions and know that trying to control yourself or your environment is a fictional idea of self-deception.

Q: Let’s talk about some of those hidden treasures regarding our bodies that we have not acknowledged yet?
THE POWER OF TASTE: Human beings existing as of today have explored maybe 15% of their taste capacity.
We can taste light but we don’t know how to.
Just like a kid who's never been taught to do mathematical tables they don't need to do them to survive.
We have yet to learn the next levels of sense of taste.
Two hundred years ago,
the naturally living could taste the air and tell you through the taste of the air if it was going to rain that day.
We can do that too.

THE POWER OF SMELL: Even though as humans we are limited in our sense of smell compared to dogs but we have a psychic scent because the nerves that make up the sense of smell still go through the third eye as parts of the rods and cones.
Our third eye is a combination of all of our sensing organs.
And the sense of smell can very much be a super,
super psychic sense.

THE SENSE OF SIGHT: The sense of sight is still a combination of ears,
and nose,
and taste,
and center of gravity that allows us to have a sense of touch through our body in motion which creates gyroscopic effects throughout our chakra systems.
There are gifted young children who can read a book by just putting their hand on it.
Our sight is intrinsically linked to the rest of our senses it can perceive touch as much as it can perceive scent and taste and sound.

THE SENSE OF SOUND: Like right now our eyes can hear because hearing is an integral part of speaking.
A person that has been deaf their whole life can feel the vibrations of their voice which makes up their language system.
Their eyes feel the vibration as much as their nose and their tongue and the rest of their body.

Q: Let’s talk about REMOTE VIEWING – URI GELLER
Well,
let's break down remote viewing versus remote experiencing.
Empathy is the lowest scale of observational skill sets the way that remote viewing is described by Ed Dames and the people that originally brought it out.
There are many different modalities of remote viewing.
Just like Reiki there are many versions of reiki passed down in a lineage that differ from the original Sensei Usui one.
Some remote viewing versions are more advanced and some are super simplistic.
Remote viewing can be a state of perception which is the lower levels of psychic expression or there is clairvoyance,
clairaudience,
clairsentience which are all much higher experiences that you may have in a remote viewing session.

Who remembers Uri Geller? He was known as a magician for bending spoons but he used a lot more of those hidden treasures,
capacities we are talking about.
He was a clairvoyant,
known as a remote viewer and hired by the oil and gas industry,
by many major corporations to find oil and gold.
He made boatloads of money helping them find natural resources all over the world.
As a dowser he didn't use any rods just his hands and intuition,
marking oil resources on a map as he was flying over a particular area.
As a person operating in an era where there were far less restrictions on psychic skills in the mid 70s to the late 90s even now he is still relevant.
Part of what he did was allow people to accept that anyone could have a psychic skill and that it could be used in professional business.
American or European corporates aren’t really big on allowing psychic skill sets.
The second you travel to China,
every major business meeting in which contracts are negotiated and signed,
the CEOs are flanked by psychics.
There are freelance psychics that are hired by companies,
because of the type of skill sets they have to understand the negotiating patterns of the person in front of them.
There is not a single contract in Hong Kong or China that is signed without psychic approval which is a very ancient tradition and business practice.

Q: What made Uri Geller so different to any of us? His spiritual contracts in a modern age of modern media.
He was the first psychic superstar since the Elizabethian mystics.
At the age of five,
being hit by a laser beam coming from an orb in a field,
he became activated to develop his skills ie bending spoons etc.
He trusted his skills without doubt and hesitation and synchronicities started lining up.
Those synchronicities were pre-arranged through the foetus of the womb blueprint to make him highly exposed to billions of households worldwide.
It is fair to say in ancient time he was a highly notable personality that had many lifetimes of great notability for whatever subject matter he got himself into.
Therefore his energy or essence was easily recognizable which allowed for grand spiritual contracts of recognition through media.
He inspired millions of people to go and look at their esoteric,
spiritual and psychic journey.
Controversial his nature,
he was one of the first ones to break the glass ceiling of what a psychic could do,
which forever created attacks against him.
Even when he left the public eye the attacks still continued to damage his name.
That just made him more popular,
enough to jump generations.
Uri Geller is a great example to illustrate possible capacities that require discipline and courage,
which are not mystical,
to succeed.
If you look at my journey I now had nine years of practice on air and twenty years before that practicing privately and throughout all the work I did with my clients.
I have evolved in the way that I do things and everything I have practiced before is a fundamental part of who I am now as a presenter.
The basics of all the teachings I talk about now I can trace back in my many notebooks from the past few years.

Q: What is your take on TELEKINESIS? The amount of energy that it takes to move something telekinetically,
even just a little bit of the shake of an object is tremendous and most people don’t produce that added psychic energy in a year that is required to do it because they operate on micro volts.
For telekinesis to work,
without you being predisposed to it through spiritual contracts,
you need to be plugged into the macro volt and then the macro volt above that so that you can tap into an energy source even higher than you that is not in competition or running an agenda of instant gratification.
Many people try telekinesis and get disheartened and frustrated when they don’t succeed.
Just like shapeshifting telekinesis can be destructive and energy draining if one underestimates the fundamental requirements of macro volt connection and skill sets that would come as part of the spiritual contracts pre-programmed in the foetus of the womb.

Q: What are ENERGETIC SPEED BUMPS with regards to BILOCATION People are forced into bilocation all the time,
they just don't realize they're doing it because it isn’t what they think it is.
There are certain energy speed bumps in our environment that kick us out of our body and force us to bilocate.
Have you ever been in the parking lot,
you are going too fast and you see that speed bump at the last second? You put on the brakes accompanied by that sound to tell you that you hit it too hard.
That can kick you out of your energy frequency,
and force you to bilocate,
meaning you're behind the speed bump and suddenly you are in front of the speed bump having skipped going over it.
There is the bilocating you ahead of the speed bump and the part of you that is still located behind the speed bump joining you again in front and you never really hit that speed bump.

Energetic speed bumps naturally occur everywhere around this planet.
The negatives of our world have figured out how to make them into oversized speed bumps,
no matter how fast or slow you go it still puts you into a major up and down motion effecting your energetic field.
Think of walking through a mall at Christmas time.
The negative energies want to set up an energy speed bump every five to ten steps.
Why? Because that is how they harvest your energy,
they're not there to pick your pocket.
Every time you walk into a store and you see a sign that says Sales 70% off,
there is your energetic speed bump to energetically slow you down and pay attention to what is on sale.
Any parking lot where you keep spinning and spinning looking for a parking space could be considered one of those speed bumps slowing your down,
getting you frustrated to drain and harvest energy off you.
Billboards catching your attention would be another speed bump.
Women have been abused over millennia to be used as speed bumps in the advertising industry.

HIDDEN TREASURES : CREATING WITH THE ELEMENTS IN NATURE
WATER is programmable and as we learn to imprint on the water we can give energy to the oceans and acknowledge all ocean species and marine life including the merfolk communities.
We are at a time where we can do great healing to all sentient kind as the ocean flows through its tidal mechanics and adds a greater perspective of ebb and flow energies in our reality.
You can use the focus of that tidal energy to create intense releases and create with it.
As the tide comes in you can laser focus your awareness to the intensity of the energy and on the way out allow all of your distractions to flow out and use the potency of the ocean to help you make masterful manifestation and practices.
When you work with water use the power of the out loud,
name it to claim it process.
Give the water your voice and as it is going out you are sending programming and that potency of intention out to the farthest edges of the ocean to share your spiritual cord of equity with every cell and atom of water that is in the great food chain of life.
Begin to acknowledge all ocean life including the shrimp and kelp in the prayer process as well as the great ocean itself and its life force and allow it to speak to you through the tidal action,
confirming and affirming your feelings for the programmed water.
In this undertaking of intimately relating you will experience a whole new layer of understanding.
A valid history lesson will be being taught by the programs of this water on this planet and the truth will be told.

This planet has had its water and snow stolen from it over hundreds of generations.
Global disasters have been purposely created to redistribute the ancient water that was imprinted by high dimensional beings and whose goal it was to protect the Earth.
Throughout those catastrophes deepest water would come to the surface to be reprogrammed by technological species using false light technology.
Water was taken off the planet by the trillions of gallons of snow and ice to plant it on other worlds and replace it with polluted water for Earth to cleanse it and clear its karma.
The merfolk community can tell the stories of those thefts and betrayals and account for how much garbage was returned.
Some water was more valuable than the rarest minerals which is part of why there are so many sub and surface species that are looking for the reserves of the ancient programmed water.
During the industrialisation age the main water wars ended as they ran out of excuses to take out miles and miles of ice.

A powerful example of creating with Storms: In one of the shows a lady from Jamaica phoned in feeling activated on a DNA level through the storms on the island.
Jamaica is surrounded by coral reefs and sits on top of a giant crystal.
That crystal creates piezoelectrical effects when under pressure.
When a hurricane comes towards Jamaica the piezoelectrical impact is increased up to three hundredfold or more as well as the background electromagnetic Schumann resonance.
The hurricane itself has low pressure that is affecting the physical body forcing more electricity to go through the auric field.
That can create an anxiety effect as we don’t know what to do with the energy.
Past practitioners on Jamaica where weather manipulators who could harvest the energy and use them for massive magical rituals to help heal the land,
nourish the soil to grow better crops and heal people or redirect the energy back into the storm to balance the next year’s harvest.
When you are in tune with the weather you can literally become the storm.
As you start living in harmony with it you can ask the elements to shift the clouds.
In the journey of being meaningful and aligned to that energy you will learn new ways of interacting with it.
Instead of just moving the storm you can add your energy to it to balance out karma.
Every drop of rain and every gust of wind is a balancing of energetic karma.
You can bring your blessings and purity to that storm,
give it a ‘wind colonic’.
A storm can be a perfect time to create with like that caller working on conception.
The storm is like allowing the egg to hatch because the veil between realities is thin when the storm moves through.
One can tap into the energy of the storm itself and increase the fertility factor by putting the wind energy into the sperm and the egg.
Both partners can guide it to connect through the storm and allow the background electromagnetic radiation and the energy of the storm to create that fertile communion.
The storm can be the portal,
the soul is already there.

VULCANO
When Mount St Helens went off the energy was equivalent to 1600 times the size of Hiroshima,
that’s how much power was behind it.
The Krakatoa volcano explosion in 1883 in Indonesia was so loud that everyone in the world could hear it,
gigantic dust particles were put into the air.
The energy that is produced through a volcanic eruption is easily harvestable by off world technology.
Inside the pyroclastic cloud which is destructive to living sentients is pure static electricity,
pure energy that can be absorbed into the offworld vessels purely by being in the cloud.
Ufos can easily enter and leave the clouds,
it often almost looks like they are shooting beams of energy into the volcano.
When the volcano settles it creates lava tubes,
access to the deep underground sites.
Those volcanic explosions create pure energy and people are attracted to live close by.
They would have spiritual contracts to choose to live there and experience regular spikes of super high frequency,
not all positive to their energy and physical bodies.

FLOODS & HURRICANES
Depending on how the flood forms electromagnetic frequencies are being created.
The water,
as it is moving,
is stripping electrons from the surface and increasing speed of the moving water.
When a dam breaks there is pressure creating rapid flow.
Tidal energy is constantly bashing up against the shore.
Hurricanes push the water inland as well as Tsunamis,
they are both rapid releases of electromagnetic energies.
All these occurrences have wisdom and bring along treasures.
What happens on the unseen side? Negative entities getting swept away.
In New Orleans,
after the hurricane,
was a massive purging of five centuries of ghosts.
The city was never the same after that as many ghost communities had left who had figured out to harvest the land as well as the people.

BACKGROUND ELEMENTALS
There are other interlinked particles that are BACKGROUND ELEMENTALS that remain part of the Ocean of Awareness without individuating into animated consciousness until we have the language to describe them as well as those extremely rare ones existing on this and other planets,
a potent contribution to our lives and yet not made available to us to the true extent possible.

The emergence of self-healing and transformation from metallic materials presents an exciting paradigm for an idea of the combination of metallic and biological properties.
How does the Earth and we as human beings interact with those elements in our environment? Every planet has a different crystalline layer that is a massive piezoelectric field.
On a planetary level,
the right mixture of elemental compounds embedded with crystals is called the slurry.
There are some planets where gold is very rare.
A planet with less gold resources does not have a naturally high electromagnetic cycle.
As electromagnetic waves from the solar system,
like solar flares,
hit a planet it will retain them for a period of time and go through an evolutionary process,
different for each planet.

Q: How does Oxygen interact with us and the planet? The OXYGEN in our air is not pure.
It’s a mix of oxygen,
nitrogen,
carbon monoxide,
water etc,
all influenced by the global weather patterns on giant and micro scale.
The same with oxygen inside lakes,
rivers and puddles as part of the hologram in which we are entangled as particles moving through that hologram.
Through the entanglement with the weather patterns we are being subjected to the changes.
We are at cause & effect of the weather until we build a house that keeps us protected in a bubble of reality even though the weather is still raging outside.
Having said that it still effects us inside the house through pressure as water is blended with oxygen in the air that we breath.
We can manipulate the weather,
the clouds.
How often have you looked at the clouds and a face looked back at you? Everyone sees something different,
this has nothing to do with interfering with any sovereign boundaries.
There are enough shared reality rules within our bubbles to allow simultaneous and shared vision.
What happens when a meteoroid shows up? There is a different set of interactive rules for the hologram.
It is something that is operating in the bigger hologram impacting on the smaller one with entangled observers within it.

Q: What is a temporary ELEMENTAL INTELLIGENCE and can you give us an example? Whilst oxygen is the basis for life here on Earth there are planets that don't have oxygen.
Life can exist in the rolling particles of dust with the dust creating its own electromagnetic field.
These are things that are,
like willows of the whisk,
things floating around in the bogs in the marshes that give off gases associated to electromagnetic frequency.
When they reach a certain layer,
just above the dew point,
they actually will come together on an etheric level and become a temporary elemental intelligence which will resolve after having accomplished its mission.
For example one form of this intelligence would stir up stagnate energy in places and space.
Another elemental intelligence can help beings that have crossed over to find their tunnel of light or assisting in the seed process of growing microorganisms deep in the ground.

Q: So where do these elementals take instructions from? They take their instructions from the celestial mind of the planet but also the caretakers of each specific realm.
We can break our planet down into 8,
600 realms.
Each realm has its own independent time as well as specific purpose with different types of elemental entities and background rules.
If you are living next to a mountain,
you obviously have much more granite around you than if you are living in a cornfield.
Corn is its own etheric lifeforce entity but here we are talking just about the elementals which are more like a semi-automated response.
They have intelligence to them to accomplish their tasks and to know if they are working outside of their mission.
Those 8,
600 realms span over the surface timeline only.
There are separate realms that are like counties inside a state in hollow earth,
differently set up though.
These realms don't store information from the Akash.
The akashic records are still in the North Pole and South Pole in the Aurora Borealis.
This is technically where their access point location is for the hubs of interconnectivity even though you can access the akashic Records from anywhere on the planet.
These temporary elemental intelligences are like the Earth’s antibodies.
They make grids and patterns that create ancestor resolution and ancestral procreation on the lands as well as clean up toxic energies if something goes into extinction and there is no surface lineage left to do the work.
In the elemental’s journey they often don't take a straight line to get to their resolution because they kind of have this wandering energy.
Standing stones that were implemented to make straight lines to energy locations,
can hurt other elemental energies and are a different type of technology .

Q: GOLD & SILVER as part of earth & our bodies? Earth has more gold than we can use.
There is gold everywhere in our backyards,
just in flex and there are positive ways to mine gold too.
We are unfortunately using gold for the wrong purpose,
90% is for industrial use and only 10% recreational.
Think about that.
Gold is meant to be available to all of us.
There is a reason why the Mayans adored all the walls with gold.
It amplifies our frequencies and when you imprint messages into the gold,
through carvings,
moulding it into advanced figurines,
you create prayer spaces that can absorb those holograms.
Imagine a ton of gold to be used to line the inside of a house,
all corners and walls including the ceiling and floor lined with gold.
It is going to amplify the frequency of that home no matter what you do in it.
Your clarity can be increased by as much as 80% as anything that has an electromagnetic frequency will have high clarity through being in contact with Gold.
Gold allows electricity to move through circuits faster.
Anything that is set up like a circuitry,
whether it is DNA or the way stones are aligned it will increase the flow.

We naturally have plenty of gold inside our bodies,
all sorts of natural metals.
It is inside the general body system,
inside our chemical matrix.
We have the capacity to naturally transmute and make gold inside our bodies at any moment in time.
And then there is SILVER,
a natural antiviral,
antibiotic element that just kills the microorganism around you.
People are using colloidal silver and there is colloidal gold too that can be directly absorbed into the body.

Gold can also be used against us.
They took elemental technology from super high scientific beings and then designed living structures for very low educated and low willed beings to live in.
The intention was that if they could get three generations to live in these gold frequency buildings,
the fourth generation would be even more harvestable as entities that would be effective for our upper crust work.
.

Q: What about the imprinting on the gold itself,
like on gold coins? When you take the imprint out of the gold,
it's still precious gold.
Whatever myth or history that is impressed into an element or metal is part of a mutual cocreation.
Pure,
unimprinted gold is a form of technology and amplifies a being’s consciousness in unawareness or awareness depending on their level of belief.
Churches are full of gold layered walls and objects which is a different way of projecting.
Some will attribute any high moments of frequency to religious dogmas created through the common thought structure and not really understand the elemental interaction of the gold as high frequency provider itself.
Hundreds of thousands of species have used gold to amplify frequencies.
It is very common throughout the universe,
the Egyptians,
the Mayans,
all of the ancient people coated everything in gold to increase the frequency.
Pyramid structures are frequency amplifiers too.
Take the Giza Pyramid,
which is pretty big,
anything within 90 km or so is going to be affected by its frequency no matter how close you are.
It's a way to put circuitry to spirituality and divest its energy and harvest it,
and then redirect it through the pyramid structure.

Q: What are some of the special skills developed through working with gold,
silver,
copper? Lining a room with gold would be for a very specific type of personality and practitioner,
beings that are powerful projectors and then even more powerful receivers.
For a clairvoyant or clairsentient being in a golden room could exponentialize the remote viewing experience.
The next super level up is receiving information.
The practitioners project themselves to a different location with high forms of clarity and other people in the room will be able to see them as a generated hologram.
You could have one to four people go out to observe and ten to twenty people see the holograms that are being generated around them.
If you were to add silver and copper to the gold in the room,
you would have high forms of kinetic control capacities.
A human being can learn to manipulate vibration and kinetic energy by touching a wall and feel the vibration in it.
The entire pyramid is a vibrational structure.
It is meant to harvest vibration deep from the planet and then center that vibration in its structure to create a powerful resonator.
When the human being knows how to kinetically control they can resonated with stones,
make them float as if they were weightless,
move them around and create whatever they want.
By adding silver and copper to gold you can change the elemental nature and capacity.
They would use this inside factories for mass productions by several thousand workers who were using these advanced kinetic skills.

Using the mix of copper,
silver,
gold,
and then have a big giant crystal in the center,
whatever would be operating around the crystal could instantly enter the peasy electric field,
amplify it and power technology with it.
We could tap into the background energy frequencies in the field around us and direct energy towards technology for direct absorbance.
This capacity is built into the human skin suit.
This is why we can go to founder technology places or other worlds that are super high technology.
When you get a human with those skills they are highly valuable in all the galaxy out there that uses humans to run their machines.

Q: How does jewellery impact on our capacities? In all reality,
unless it's a heavy solid gold necklace,
you have very little gold on you.
You need volume,
think of the thickness of the plaster on your wall to make it sound and stable? The same thing goes for the gold when you are wearing and putting elements around you.
The different golds in the gold family vary in colours because they are pressurized differently and they have different effects.
Platinum is not pure gold.
Rose Gold is mixed with copper.
Gold or silver jewellery is directly tied to your Meridian system and can make a huge difference for your health and wellness.
Does bigger make better? When it comes to elements like gold,
silver,
and copper,
yes,
it does.
Density and volume does make a difference of how your bioelectric field reacts to your environment because it is constantly amplifying your bioelectric field.

Q: What about the association of gold to the masculine and the sun? Now that's something that was imprinted by the religions of that era.
The high energy beings who understood the galactic spiritual commerce market decided to idolize the sun because it made more potent souls who could operate high-frequency technology.
So they crafted a story that brought a lot more potent souls into the farm,
which they could then harvest.
The 8,
600 realms on our surface,
each one is a different farm.

Silver has many uses.
If you would have a bed made solely of silver,
a lattice network of micro,
silver fibres that make up a bed it would be very powerful.
Think of it like a box spring but super compressed replacing your mattress.
When you sleep on a silver compressed mattress like that the silver itself is under torsion which allows the body to dream even deeper and enter deep delta frequencies.
You could add a variety of other elements and crystals to it to help create affinities to certain realms.
The imprinted view of scarcity of gold and silver is part of the manipulation used in this narrative.
Imagine people would have unlimited access to those elements and start using them to not just wear but lining their walls with it?
Q: What are the properties of COPPER? Copper filters particles to be energized.
If you have a magnet and you were to put metal shavings on a piece of paper you could see the magnetic field.
There are some magnetic shavings that take longer exposure to get magnetized.
There are some things that are non-ferrous and you can magnetize them by intensifying the field through the use of copper.
Copper in its natural environment would generally not be in a rock shape.
It would have crystal,
silver,
gold,
additional water,
one or two additional types of elements around it acting as a massive amplifier of the actual background energy.

Copper in coil form can be used under the bed to negate toxic energies,
like the curry lines.
Yes but in the old days they knew how to manipulate the Curry lines in such a way that it was very beneficial to the earth.
Are you familiar with Michael Tellinger’s work? Have you seen the stone circles that are all over the African desert,
tens of millions of those examples of circuitry? The Hartman Curry line circuitry created a very effective way of literally harvesting the surface or the energy for many uses.
They built hospitals,
work houses and schools being able to read the energy of what was right for the place.

Q: What about other elements like PLUTONIMUM? Atomic weapons are made out of plutonium.
Plutonium can be found everywhere deeply under the ground and it creates negative frequency when it becomes very dense.
What do you think plutonium does as a background element? It’s radioactive and everyone talks about it having a long life.
How would this radioactivity impact on the a human being? It is not necessarily unhealthy as it can charge the energy and make it move at the plutonium decay rate.
Plutonium can overwrite bioelectric circuitry.
That is the nature of the radiation.
If you take plutonium from its original deep surface radiating source and expose it to the sun,
let's say in a high desert,
its radioactivity would begin to reflect that of the sun and become very potent energy generating and regenerating life forms.
Gigantic life growing farms if they could get the water to high deserts and transmute plutonium through sunlight.
At the moment it is used for nuclear weapons and in very low levels in can be in batteries and lots of other things.
At low levels it won’t hurt you.

Q: What about TITANIUM? Titanium is a biological entity that has to go through an evolutionary completion state before it becomes titanium.
The way strands align themselves,
when observed under a specialised DNA microscope they have a semi helix circle pattern to them in their arrangements of their densities.
Titanium can be melded with many other types of metals and mega titanium,
which is a specialized titanium alloy,
has very unique properties to it.
It is used to replace steel as it is so strong.
Instead of one inch of steel you can go with an eighth inch of titanium and it has the same strength.
It is also used for dentistry,
making drill bits.

Titanium can be bonded with other alloys for antennas for instance.
When you build a cell tower out of pure titanium and allow it to go a thousand feet up in the air you would be able to harvest energy off it.
Titanium allows torsion,
twisting and bending without breaking,
extremely weather resistant.
You could install it anywhere in the world and create 500 times more energy than a solar or wind driven turbine,
a highly dense sturdy structure that can be used as multiple energy source.

It can mix with human beings too.
Solidified Titanium can be turned into a liquid form that uses electromagnetic energy as its network of absorption through the actual energy pool that it is.
This then can instantly solidify as armour around the being without inhibiting mobility.
It can turn into an actually piece of technology,
an exosuit that instantly adapts to whatever environment you are in.
Let’s say you come from planet Earth with sufficient levels of oxygen and step through a portal onto Mars where there isn’t enough oxygen.

These technologies we will be using when getting out there to other worlds as consciousness explorers.
It will be an entirely new education journey of changing environments,
leaving the planet and getting onto living on ships for extended periods of time to acclimatise to the radically different frequencies of other planets.
Depending on the DNA skinsuits it will affect everybody differently.
They have these tests that can tell you if you are going to have a harsh reaction to a specific planet or not.
So you will know where to go and where not to.
There are other species that are doing this as well as Earth’s Secret Space Program is going well beyond the Solar System.
They’ve got around 4,
300 bases outside of our solar system with about 180 billion human beings that have been harvested off our world since 1830.

Q: IRIDIUM? If you are harvesting raw electricity Iridium can be very useful.
It is a hard day gauge and you can produce crucibles,
very heat resistant containers in which metals or other substances can be melted.
Whilst Iridium is very rare here on earth you can find it all over the galaxy and solar system.

Q: PALLADIUM? This is one of those elements that continues to give mystery to the rest of the universe.
Palladium is worth more than gold.
Palladium is the most valuable of the four precious metals with an acute shortage here on Earth driving prices up to record levels.
The usage is increasing as governments,
especially China has tightened the regulations,
the crack down on pollution from vehicles,
forcing us to increase the amount of precious metals they use.
Palladium has very unique energy factors to it.
It doesn't allow anything to live on its surface and kills all microorganisms by catalysing the environment.
It keeps energy moving very fast before slowing down.
You  can imagine the beneficial impact on technology and jewellery.

Q: The structure & Coding of elements,
nature,
DNA: There is a structure to all of those metals,
that is part of the coding.
Part of the problem is that we don't yet understand the fullness of the coding.
What does it mean to have those metals in our environment and how to entangle with them as a hologram that is part of us? You can relate those codes to the soul coding we have in our DNA.
All those elements have their own version of that.
There is a common code and structure to those elements that allow you to turn them on as a biological entity.
If your DNA has a biological consciousness,
resonant frequency inside it,
you will have one of the many codes to activate it as a natural living being.
Those elements are most beneficial to us and should be in every of our background frequency and energies,
in our walls,
bricks,
houses,
roadways,
elevators,
community centres.
The lack of information and use is part of the system of domination and control keeping our DNA capacities dumbed down.
All the geometric structures and codes found in nature,
in our DNA and in those elements allow us to interact,
access,
activate and directly interface with each other.

Q: What about the building material of the Titanic? With the example of the Titanic,
the majority of magic was more in the people,
the operating system rather than the building material.
Whatever they did on the material was an esoteric journey of imprinting but it didn’t mean the metal would accept it.
The crew members of the Titanic were esoterically trained by the secret societies of that era,
to be the religion of the ship,
which was very common throughout the entire British history.
You had a priest and then you had another guy who taught you something different to what the church taught you.
At that point what the ship was built of was irrelevant even though they did rituals and ceremonies.

Q: What do you mean by harvesting elements through our existence as a paradox? There are many more elements on this planet but we don't know what they are being used for in other worldly technologies.
There are some elements that are so unique and rare that they can only exist in a previous paradox.
We as the many I AM selves,
embodied and expressed through the I AM Apex here are a living,
breathing paradox.
Just by us moving around in our multidimensional energy we could leave a manifestation behind,
a microlevel compound that has not existed in the in the universe before.
There are galactic agents that are constantly sniffing around our cities for micro compounds and micro elements that are transmuted and left behind by us.
Make no mistake,
every aspect of the farm has been commoditized as part of the Galactic Commerce Market.

Q: How would we do that by moving around? Everyone is a living breathing paradox inside a paradox timeline reality to participate and create final karmic resolution.
We are a paradox inside a paradox inside a paradox inside another paradox which opens up a wide range of opportunities to create those new micro elements.
Every time you go into a medium level of energy,
let's just say happily driving a car and listening to some music you could be producing elements and micro compounds that have never existed before and because they're not attached to your bubble of hologram they will fall out behind you like dust particles,
micro dust particles.
They are not attached to the hologram because the paradox is bringing them through the membranes of reality.
Fairy dust! Yes,
this is just another way that the entire planet from ground up is here to resolve karma.
Even the leaves are designed to fall a certain way to resolve karma.
The entire surface timeline on this planet is a machine to resolve karma.
As our shards,
parts and avatars are working together in unison and harmony together with our environment we are creating potent and powerful elements in awareness or unawareness.
The more we are in our joy and authentic expression we can create magic like that.
The fact that we are not surrounded by all those rare and hidden elements and metals in our city structures and homes the lack frequency is being amplified.
