## Floods and Hurricanes

Electromagnetic frequencies are created in a flood.
The water strips electrons from the surface as it moves.
This increases the speed of the water.
A dam break creates rapid flow of water.
Tidal energy rolls into the shores of the world.
Hurricanes push the water inland,
as do Tsunamis.
They're both rapid releases of electromagnetic energy.
All these occurrences have wisdom and bring treasures.
On the unseen side negative entities get swept away.
Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans was a massive purge of five centuries of ghosts.
The city was never the same after Katrina.
The ghost communities had figured out how to harvest the land and the people.
The energetics of the hurricane destroyed their psycho-spiritual ecosystem,
their economy.


## Background Elementals

Background elementals are interlinked particles,
part of the ocean of awareness without individuation,
not yet formed into animated consciousness.
We don't have any literature on them in the esoteric record.
The term itself is appointed here.
Extremely rare background elementals exist on earth and other planets.
They could be a potent contribution to our lives.
They are not yet available to us as a consciousness interaction.
How the earth,
and we as human beings on the earth,
interact with these elements in our environment is as astounding as everything else in the spiritual economy.
Every planet has a different crystalline layer,
and each is a unique piezoelectric field.
The right mixture of elemental compounds embedded with crystals on a planet is called the slurry.
There are planets where gold is very rare.
A planet with less gold resources doesn't have a naturally high electromagnetic cycle.
Electromagnetic waves from the solar system are constant,
solar flares for example.
The planet retains them for a period of time.
They assist in an evolutionary process  which is different for each planet.

Oxygen in our air is not pure.
It’s a mix of oxygen,
nitrogen,
carbon monoxide,
water,
and other parts,
all influenced by the global weather patterns on macro and micro scales.
The same is true for oxygen inside lakes,
rivers,
and puddles.
Through entanglement with weather patterns we're being subjected to changes.
A shelter keeps us protected even though the weather rages outside.
It effects us inside the house through pressure.
Water is blended with oxygen in the air we breath.


Oxygen is the basis of life on earth.
There are planets with no oxygen.
Life can exist in the rolling particles of dust.
The dust creates its own electromagnetic field.
Willows of the whisk,
or other things floating around in the bogs and marshes,
produce gases associated to electromagnetic frequency.
When these gases reach a certain layer just above the dew point they come together on the etheric level and become a temporary elemental intelligence.
It resolves after accomplishing its mission.
For example one form of this intelligence would stir up stagnate energy in places and space.
Another elemental intelligence can help beings that have crossed over to find their tunnel of light or assisting in the seed process of growing microorganisms deep in the ground.

Q: So where do these elementals take instructions from? They take their instructions from the celestial mind of the planet but also the caretakers of each specific realm.
We can break our planet down into 8,
600 realms.
Each realm has its own independent time as well as specific purpose with different types of elemental entities and background rules.
If you are living next to a mountain,
you obviously have much more granite around you than if you are living in a cornfield.
Corn is its own etheric lifeforce entity but here we're talking just about the elementals which are more like a semi-automated response.
They have intelligence to them to accomplish their tasks and to know if they are working outside of their mission.
Those 8,
600 realms span over the surface timeline only.
There are separate realms that are like counties inside a state in hollow earth,
differently set up though.
These realms don't store information from the Akash.
The akashic records are still in the North Pole and South Pole in the Aurora Borealis.
This is technically where their access point location is for the hubs of interconnectivity even though you can access the akashic Records from anywhere on the planet.
These temporary elemental intelligences are like the Earth’s antibodies.
They make grids and patterns that create ancestor resolution and ancestral procreation on the lands as well as clean up toxic energies if something goes into extinction and there is no surface lineage left to do the work.
In the elemental’s journey they often don't take a straight line to get to their resolution because they kind of have this wandering energy.
Standing stones that were implemented to make straight lines to energy locations,
can hurt other elemental energies and are a different type of technology .

Q: GOLD & SILVER as part of earth & our bodies? Earth has more gold than we can use.
There is gold everywhere in our backyards,
just in flex and there are positive ways to mine gold too.
We're unfortunately using gold for the wrong purpose,
90% is for industrial use and only 10% recreational.
Think about that.
Gold is meant to be available to all of us.
There is a reason why the Mayans adored all the walls with gold.
It amplifies our frequencies and when you imprint messages into the gold,
through carvings,
moulding it into advanced figurines,
you create prayer spaces that can absorb those holograms.
Imagine a ton of gold to be used to line the inside of a house,
all corners and walls including the ceiling and floor lined with gold.
It is going to amplify the frequency of that home no matter what you do in it.
Your clarity can be increased by as much as 80% as anything that has an electromagnetic frequency will have high clarity through being in contact with Gold.
Gold allows electricity to move through circuits faster.
Anything that is set up like a circuitry,
whether it is DNA or the way stones are aligned it will increase the flow.

We naturally have plenty of gold inside our bodies,
all sorts of natural metals.
It is inside the general body system,
inside our chemical matrix.
We have the capacity to naturally transmute and make gold inside our bodies at any moment in time.
And then there is SILVER,
a natural antiviral,
antibiotic element that just kills the microorganism around you.
People are using colloidal silver and there is colloidal gold too that can be directly absorbed into the body.

Gold can also be used against us.
They took elemental technology from super high scientific beings and then designed living structures for very low educated and low willed beings to live in.
The intention was that if they could get three generations to live in these gold frequency buildings,
the fourth generation would be even more harvestable as entities that would be effective for our upper crust work.
.

Q: What about the imprinting on the gold itself,
like on gold coins? When you take the imprint out of the gold,
it's still precious gold.
Whatever myth or history that is impressed into an element or metal is part of a mutual cocreation.
Pure,
unimprinted gold is a form of technology and amplifies a being’s consciousness in unawareness or awareness depending on their level of belief.
Churches are full of gold layered walls and objects which is a different way of projecting.
Some will attribute any high moments of frequency to religious dogmas created through the common thought structure and not really understand the elemental interaction of the gold as high frequency provider itself.
Hundreds of thousands of species have used gold to amplify frequencies.
It is very common throughout the universe,
the Egyptians,
the Mayans,
all of the ancient people coated everything in gold to increase the frequency.
Pyramid structures are frequency amplifiers too.
Take the Giza Pyramid,
which is pretty big,
anything within 90 km or so is going to be affected by its frequency no matter how close you are.
It's a way to put circuitry to spirituality and divest its energy and harvest it,
and then redirect it through the pyramid structure.

Q: What are some of the special skills developed through working with gold,
silver,
copper? Lining a room with gold would be for a very specific type of personality and practitioner,
beings that are powerful projectors and then even more powerful receivers.
For a clairvoyant or clairsentient being in a golden room could exponentialize the remote viewing experience.
The next super level up is receiving information.
The practitioners project themselves to a different location with high forms of clarity and other people in the room will be able to see them as a generated hologram.
You could have one to four people go out to observe and ten to twenty people see the holograms that are being generated around them.
If you were to add silver and copper to the gold in the room,
you would have high forms of kinetic control capacities.
A human being can learn to manipulate vibration and kinetic energy by touching a wall and feel the vibration in it.
The entire pyramid is a vibrational structure.
It is meant to harvest vibration deep from the planet and then center that vibration in its structure to create a powerful resonator.
When the human being knows how to kinetically control they can resonated with stones,
make them float as if they were weightless,
move them around and create whatever they want.
By adding silver and copper to gold you can change the elemental nature and capacity.
They would use this inside factories for mass productions by several thousand workers who were using these advanced kinetic skills.

Using the mix of copper,
silver,
gold,
and then have a big giant crystal in the center,
whatever would be operating around the crystal could instantly enter the peasy electric field,
amplify it and power technology with it.
We could tap into the background energy frequencies in the field around us and direct energy towards technology for direct absorbance.
This capacity is built into the human skin suit.
This is why we can go to founder technology places or other worlds that are super high technology.
When you get a human with those skills they are highly valuable in all the galaxy out there that uses humans to run their machines.

Q: How does jewellery impact on our capacities? In all reality,
unless it's a heavy solid gold necklace,
you have very little gold on you.
You need volume,
think of the thickness of the plaster on your wall to make it sound and stable? The same thing goes for the gold when you are wearing and putting elements around you.
The different golds in the gold family vary in colours because they are pressurized differently and they have different effects.
Platinum is not pure gold.
Rose Gold is mixed with copper.
Gold or silver jewellery is directly tied to your Meridian system and can make a huge difference for your health and wellness.
Does bigger make better? When it comes to elements like gold,
silver,
and copper,
yes,
it does.
Density and volume does make a difference of how your bioelectric field reacts to your environment because it is constantly amplifying your bioelectric field.

Q: What about the association of gold to the masculine and the sun? Now that's something that was imprinted by the religions of that era.
The high energy beings who understood the galactic spiritual commerce market decided to idolize the sun because it made more potent souls who could operate high-frequency technology.
So they crafted a story that brought a lot more potent souls into the farm,
which they could then harvest.
The 8,
600 realms on our surface,
each one is a different farm.

Silver has many uses.
If you would have a bed made solely of silver,
a lattice network of micro,
silver fibres that make up a bed it would be very powerful.
Think of it like a box spring but super compressed replacing your mattress.
When you sleep on a silver compressed mattress like that the silver itself is under torsion which allows the body to dream even deeper and enter deep delta frequencies.
You could add a variety of other elements and crystals to it to help create affinities to certain realms.
The imprinted view of scarcity of gold and silver is part of the manipulation used in this narrative.
Imagine people would have unlimited access to those elements and start using them to not just wear but lining their walls with it?
Q: What are the properties of COPPER? Copper filters particles to be energized.
If you have a magnet and you were to put metal shavings on a piece of paper you could see the magnetic field.
There are some magnetic shavings that take longer exposure to get magnetized.
There are some things that are non-ferrous and you can magnetize them by intensifying the field through the use of copper.
Copper in its natural environment would generally not be in a rock shape.
It would have crystal,
silver,
gold,
additional water,
one or two additional types of elements around it acting as a massive amplifier of the actual background energy.

Copper in coil form can be used under the bed to negate toxic energies,
like the curry lines.
Yes but in the old days they knew how to manipulate the Curry lines in such a way that it was very beneficial to the earth.
Are you familiar with Michael Tellinger’s work? Have you seen the stone circles that are all over the African desert,
tens of millions of those examples of circuitry? The Hartman Curry line circuitry created a very effective way of literally harvesting the surface or the energy for many uses.
They built hospitals,
work houses and schools being able to read the energy of what was right for the place.

Q: What about other elements like PLUTONIMUM? Atomic weapons are made out of plutonium.
Plutonium can be found everywhere deeply under the ground and it creates negative frequency when it becomes very dense.
What do you think plutonium does as a background element? It’s radioactive and everyone talks about it having a long life.
How would this radioactivity impact on the a human being? It is not necessarily unhealthy as it can charge the energy and make it move at the plutonium decay rate.
Plutonium can overwrite bioelectric circuitry.
That is the nature of the radiation.
If you take plutonium from its original deep surface radiating source and expose it to the sun,
let's say in a high desert,
its radioactivity would begin to reflect that of the sun and become very potent energy generating and regenerating life forms.
Gigantic life growing farms if they could get the water to high deserts and transmute plutonium through sunlight.
At the moment it is used for nuclear weapons and in very low levels in can be in batteries and lots of other things.
At low levels it won’t hurt you.

Q: What about TITANIUM? Titanium is a biological entity that has to go through an evolutionary completion state before it becomes titanium.
The way strands align themselves,
when observed under a specialised DNA microscope they have a semi helix circle pattern to them in their arrangements of their densities.
Titanium can be melded with many other types of metals and mega titanium,
which is a specialized titanium alloy,
has very unique properties to it.
It is used to replace steel as it is so strong.
Instead of one inch of steel you can go with an eighth inch of titanium and it has the same strength.
It is also used for dentistry,
making drill bits.

Titanium can be bonded with other alloys for antennas for instance.
When you build a cell tower out of pure titanium and allow it to go a thousand feet up in the air you would be able to harvest energy off it.
Titanium allows torsion,
twisting and bending without breaking,
extremely weather resistant.
You could install it anywhere in the world and create 500 times more energy than a solar or wind driven turbine,
a highly dense sturdy structure that can be used as multiple energy source.

It can mix with human beings too.
Solidified Titanium can be turned into a liquid form that uses electromagnetic energy as its network of absorption through the actual energy pool that it is.
This then can instantly solidify as armour around the being without inhibiting mobility.
It can turn into an actually piece of technology,
an exosuit that instantly adapts to whatever environment you are in.
Let’s say you come from planet Earth with sufficient levels of oxygen and step through a portal onto Mars where there isn’t enough oxygen.

These technologies we will be using when getting out there to other worlds as consciousness explorers.
It will be an entirely new education journey of changing environments,
leaving the planet and getting onto living on ships for extended periods of time to acclimatise to the radically different frequencies of other planets.
Depending on the DNA skinsuits it will affect everybody differently.
They have these tests that can tell you if you are going to have a harsh reaction to a specific planet or not.
So you will know where to go and where not to.
There are other species that are doing this as well as Earth’s Secret Space Program is going well beyond the Solar System.
They’ve got around 4,
300 bases outside of our solar system with about 180 billion human beings that have been harvested off our world since 1830.

Q: IRIDIUM? If you are harvesting raw electricity Iridium can be very useful.
It is a hard day gauge and you can produce crucibles,
very heat resistant containers in which metals or other substances can be melted.
Whilst Iridium is very rare here on earth you can find it all over the galaxy and solar system.

Q: PALLADIUM? This is one of those elements that continues to give mystery to the rest of the universe.
Palladium is worth more than gold.
Palladium is the most valuable of the four precious metals with an acute shortage here on Earth driving prices up to record levels.
The usage is increasing as governments,
especially China has tightened the regulations,
the crack down on pollution from vehicles,
forcing us to increase the amount of precious metals they use.
Palladium has very unique energy factors to it.
It doesn't allow anything to live on its surface and kills all microorganisms by catalysing the environment.
It keeps energy moving very fast before slowing down.
You  can imagine the beneficial impact on technology and jewellery.

Q: The structure & Coding of elements,
nature,
DNA: There is a structure to all of those metals,
that is part of the coding.
Part of the problem is that we don't yet understand the fullness of the coding.
What does it mean to have those metals in our environment and how to entangle with them as a hologram that is part of us? You can relate those codes to the soul coding we have in our DNA.
All those elements have their own version of that.
There is a common code and structure to those elements that allow you to turn them on as a biological entity.
If your DNA has a biological consciousness,
resonant frequency inside it,
you will have one of the many codes to activate it as a natural living being.
Those elements are most beneficial to us and should be in every of our background frequency and energies,
in our walls,
bricks,
houses,
roadways,
elevators,
community centres.
The lack of information and use is part of the system of domination and control keeping our DNA capacities dumbed down.
All the geometric structures and codes found in nature,
in our DNA and in those elements allow us to interact,
access,
activate and directly interface with each other.

Q: What about the building material of the Titanic? With the example of the Titanic,
the majority of magic was more in the people,
the operating system rather than the building material.
Whatever they did on the material was an esoteric journey of imprinting but it didn’t mean the metal would accept it.
The crew members of the Titanic were esoterically trained by the secret societies of that era,
to be the religion of the ship,
which was very common throughout the entire British history.
You had a priest and then you had another guy who taught you something different to what the church taught you.
At that point what the ship was built of was irrelevant even though they did rituals and ceremonies.

Q: What do you mean by harvesting elements through our existence as a paradox? There are many more elements on this planet but we don't know what they are being used for in other worldly technologies.
There are some elements that are so unique and rare that they can only exist in a previous paradox.
We as the many I AM selves,
embodied and expressed through the I AM Apex here are a living,
breathing paradox.
Just by us moving around in our multidimensional energy we could leave a manifestation behind,
a microlevel compound that has not existed in the in the universe before.
There are galactic agents that are constantly sniffing around our cities for micro compounds and micro elements that are transmuted and left behind by us.
Make no mistake,
every aspect of the farm has been commoditized as part of the Galactic Commerce Market.

Q: How would we do that by moving around? Everyone is a living breathing paradox inside a paradox timeline reality to participate and create final karmic resolution.
We're a paradox inside a paradox inside a paradox inside another paradox which opens up a wide range of opportunities to create those new micro elements.
Every time you go into a medium level of energy,
let's just say happily driving a car and listening to some music you could be producing elements and micro compounds that have never existed before and because they're not attached to your bubble of hologram they will fall out behind you like dust particles,
micro dust particles.
They are not attached to the hologram because the paradox is bringing them through the membranes of reality.
Fairy dust! Yes,
this is just another way that the entire planet from ground up is here to resolve karma.
Even the leaves are designed to fall a certain way to resolve karma.
The entire surface timeline on this planet is a machine to resolve karma.
As our shards,
parts and avatars are working together in unison and harmony together with our environment we're creating potent and powerful elements in awareness or unawareness.
The more we're in our joy and authentic expression we can create magic like that.
The fact that we're not surrounded by all those rare and hidden elements and metals in our city structures and homes the lack frequency is being amplified.
