## Storms


A hurricane has low pressure that affects the physical body.
It forces more electricity to through the auric field.
It can create anxiety if we don’t know what to do with the energy.
Shamans of the past were weather manipulators.
They could harvest the energy and invest it in the land.
It could nourish the soil,
grow better crops,
heal people,
or the energy could be redirected back into the storm to invest in the next year’s harvest.
It was a spiritual  economy.
It still is.
It's a spiritual economy wallpapered with fiat notes,
debt instruments,
and perpetual servitude.
How can that be?
A spiritual economy gives unconditionally because the chief characteristic of the prime creator is love.
Where does the debt come from?
When you peel back the wallpaper over our economic reality there is no debt.
The only collateral against the notes issued today is the labor of national populations.
The wallpapered economy has us borrow against our own productivity and pay an interest to various private-public third parties.
It's an energy harvest.

When we are in tune with weather we can become the storm.
In harmony with weather we can ask the elements to shift the clouds.
Instead of moving a storm we can add our energy to it to balance out karma.
Every drop of rain and gust of wind is a balancing of energetic karma.
We can bring our blessings and purity to that storm.
The veil between realities is thin when a storm moves through.
Thunder and lightning are an energetic manifestation of pure spirit on the physical plane.
They are an acknowledgment of the sound and light hologram here
&mdash;
the conductor stepping forward to bow to the audience.
We can tap into the energy of storms themselves and increase our fertility by putting the wind energy into the sperm and the egg.
Both partners can guide it to connect through the storm.
The background electromagnetic radiation and the energy of the storm create the fertile communion.
A storm can be a portal.
The soul is already there.
