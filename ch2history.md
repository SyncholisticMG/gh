================


Q: When did Temporal Awareness manipulation start? Roughly 48-55,
000 years ago but not all the forms had it,
not all of them would take temporal manipulation that way.
Again,
it was all about limiting the amount of forms on the surface.
Something like you are not going to live on the surface because your particular DNA lineage won’t be receptive to this temporal awareness manipulation.
That’s why they went from 900,
000 different forms to 135,
000.
This is all about the basis of DNA farming and how they would manipulate and limit who was going to be in the farm.

Q: How can we take back our temporal awareness and use it to our advantage? Getting our gut health back? Our micro organism in the gut,
that has a life span as part of the cojoined frequency that we are,
then generates a natural immune system in the blood,
through the marrow in the skeletal system.
The heart filters and processes that information together with the brain into higher levels of awareness to figure out what to do with our many agendas.
This will then also improve our intra and intercommunication.
Our capacity to connect to other temporal realms through dreamtime will increase through multiple points of temporal awareness.

Q: What other temporal realms are there? Your dream realm,
it has its own frequency of time and it is fair to say there are thousands of dream realms out there with thousands of different frequencies of time.
Your gut will basically have its own checklist of all the places it has been to and will be able to verify the temporal signature frequency,
meaning your gut will resonate with the frequency of being in the right time and space.
Most intuition comes from the gut and it depends on how the brain,
heart,
gut are connected.
Guthealth was ignored on purpose by conventional medicine,
death begins in the colon.

Q: How does EYE PATTERNS RECOGNITION fit into the concept of Consciousness Entanglement? Eye movements reflect on how we access,
perceive and process information in the consciousness field.
They are an indication if we are looking towards the future or the past.
We can use certain eye positions to access our memories and thoughts as well as create new ones and gain recognition on how to stay present,
outside of emotional entanglement.
Practicing those movements and positions allows the DNA instrument to gain more flexibility and access to the information in the conscious energy field.
