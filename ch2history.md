## MIND HEART GUT SUPER HIGHWAY

Sometimes the mind processes better than the heart,
or the gut,
or the other way round.
Then there are certain pieces of information where the mind,
the heart,
and the gut have to work together.
Once the mind-heart-gut starts working together,
the analogical side of the mind
&mdash;
which compares two things
&mdash;
gets stronger,
along with the empowered programs that are with it.
This is why daily practice is so important.
Locality and non-locality are still based off the brain’s time-space location,
which is a marker signifying an anima of awareness and a flow of data.
We use the brain to interpret inter-dimensional frequencies of the multiple versions of self.
The brain is the instrument of experience.
It has a gut-brain and a heart-brain,
each with its own observance/
This allows processing of different time or no-time.
Brain,
mind,
heart,
and gut space are different natures of experience combined into one experience.

DNA communicates within the physical form.
It communicates from form to form through incarnations.
It communicates between incarnations.
It communicates to our light bodies.
It has the ability to go from chemical to light.
This understanding allows reasoned contemplation on many consequence theologies,
the wages of sin,
the sins of the father,
and karma itself,
whether applied to an individual,
a family,
a community,
a geography,
or any other distribution point;
it's all one DNA communication network,
the prime creator's backbone for several layers of experience,
straddling light and chemical,
which correlates to the physical body and the light body.
We are simultaneously living *I am* versions of ourselves,
scattered through time.
In low consciousness these other selves are unrecognized.
To quote Roy Batty from *Blade Runner*:
like *tears in the rain*.
In higher consciousness,
our awareness permits communication to multiple selves,
the consciousness of the earth itself,
and beyond.


The *I am*,
as the incarnate life form,
occupies and entangles consciousness within the body through three stages.
One,
the consciousness is in the brain-heart-gut.
The brain-heart-gut complex links to the central nervous system.
The central nervous system connects the entire fascia system through the vagus nerve
&mdash;
the central nervous system connector
&mdash;
as part of the DNA communication system.
Two,
consciousness is in the sympathetic nervous system (SN) and the parasympathetic nervous system (PSN).
Three,
consciousness is in the entire neural pathway network,
fascia,
dermis,
hairs,
the entire system.
It connects to the gallbladder which is intraconnected to the vagus nerve.
Every organ is intraconnected and interconnected to the vagus nerve.

The life form is part of the individual and collective experience.
Our life forms are on all different levels of awareness
&mdash;
planetary,
solar,
galactic,
and universal.
Contemplate the vagus nerve aligned to our magnetic North and South Pole.
The sympathetic and parasympathetic is our local space time.
The sympathetic drives our daily actions when the soul is in the body.
The parasympathetic drives the body in lucid dreaming and other spiritual states,
or when it is fully in self-defeating programs.
The sympathetic can also be self-defeating and kick the spirit out of the body.
It's driven to resolves karma.
It guides us like a compass to choose a variety of karma out of free will.
The vagus nerve is connecting to the North Pole,
our ancestors,
and to the South Pole,
our future generations.
We need to reclaim the vagus nerve as the truest spiritual sovereign authority we have.
Parasympathetic and sympathetic programs can kick us out of the body.
A sympathetic example would be road rage,
rebellious energy for the most part.
When the parasympathetic takes over and thinks it is the soul the ego and the shadow have made an alliance inside each other to manifest an internal villain,
a bully,
so the soul can’t be in the body.
In Jung’s psychology the subconscious looks upon the sympathetic as fight,
flight,
or freeze,
and it looks upon the parasympathetic as rest,
digest,
and relax.

Entanglement is the measure of how much consciousness is in control of the body.
It is measured through the vagus nerve,
the sympathetic nervous system,
and the parasympathetic nervous system.

The subconscious rest,
digest,
and relax vagus nerve connection is when we are in those spiritual moments where we are reclaiming our authority,
taking back our power and purging the vagus nerve.
Once we fully occupy the central vagus nerve with our consciousness,
we can flow it directly into the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system.
This is how the incarnate life form can retain lucid dream creations.
This explains why people run by programs have difficulty lucid dreaming.
It's difficult to make rich,
high quality memories.
The vagus nerve and the parasympathetic are connected to mystical experiences.
The sympathetic has neural pathways designed to use the five senses.
The five senses sum to the sixth sense,
the totality of the experience.

Think of a violin.
The parasympathetic system is the body of the violin.
The sympathetic system is analogous to the strings on the violin.
The vagus nerve is the bow.
Consciousness plays the violin.
The consciousness of the earth itself is the conductor.
The parasympathetic system is the resonance chamber.
These things are useless alone.
The string is nothing without the bow.
The vibration is nothing without the hollow chamber resonating with the body of the violin.
The fine tuning relates to how much the soul is in the body.

The consciousness of the planet is the conductor.
It hands out the sheet music,
the larger composition to which the individual instruments contribute
&mdash;
the blueprint of synchronicities.
Returning to our linear ocean of awareness metaphor,
the planet is the interconnection so the body
&mdash;
the life form
&mdash;
can have an intra experience with the planet.
This may be alone,
with individual family members,
cultures,
religions,
anything in the sheet music provided by the consciousness of the planet.
In this orchestration we seek harmony to make direct signature frequency matches.
The planet simultaneously exists in the ocean of awareness and the sea of consciousness.
The planet’s celestial mind is the medium between these two levels of awareness as well as the planet itself manifested in time and space so that beings living inside it can have a s set of unique experiences.
This applies to every planet in the universe,
with only a few exceptions.
The celestial mind of the planet is intraconnected with the celestial mind of us,
the life forms,
as well as intra connected with the ocean of awareness and the sea of consciousness manifesting in physical and non-physical space.

We want vagus nerve,
sympathetic,
and parasympathetic sovereignty.
This permits intra and interconnection to our celestial minds.
The journey is in maintaining sovereign connection as an ongoing experience until the experience is second nature.
At this unfoldment we can achieve other forms of embodiment.
We can leave the body and not lose control of the three aspects of consciousness entanglement.
We can create versions of ourselves in other places,
spaces,
and times.
This is our legacy as multidimensional and multi-functional beings.
We can adapt form to communicate with other places,
spaces,
and species.
Sovereignty is earned when the soul can leave at will.
DNA was designed so when we reach a certain frequency we are no longer solely within chemical experience.
Chemical exchanges are fundamental to the life forms living in this third density.
Our journey is from chemical to light.
The water
&mdash;
the fluids
&mdash;
that comprise the atoms of our bodies become a resonant amplifier.
Light based experiences happen through the refraction of water.
The soul is the light inside the body.
The water and fluid are refracting it by chemical reaction.
When you shine light through water or a prism there is no chemical separation of the prism of light.
Thoughts can be implicate and explicate at the same time
&mdash;
orgasmic experiences,
love,
and fundamental experience without thought.


Reincarnation was a trap that created karmic entanglements.
To get back to celestial mediumship,
reincarnations are optional and free willed for karmic resolution.
We achieve multidimensional living and realize leaving here was never truly the goal.
Multidimensional existence is the goal.
We can generate a part of ourselves that continues the journey while having many other parts of ourselves in other places.
The *I am* apex presence roots uncontested in the here and now.
Reincarnation and some forms of incarnation became competitive reduction journeys.
The entire experience of death is set to change.
Our lives will go to three hundred years,
five hundred,
seven hundred years in one go.
The passing over experience will persist to finish this era of light’s karmic accounts.
Our capacity to plan future lives with twenty to thirty percent of our life memories,
hundreds of millions of years as our database for mapping future lives.


We're not put on our mother’s heart for days after birth with the umbilical cord connected.
This is the natural law of harmony.
It's so simple the slightest sophistry devolves us of spiritual inheritance.
Birthing in hospitals with *licensed* medical personnel and limited bed time due to economies of utility does not complete the first synchronizing of the child.
Our *I am* technology has to come out quickly in our body in the present system.
Everything is set to slow down.
The future will see more natural birthing.
Pregnancy will be between nine and twenty-five months.


There are children here now with a good part of their memory available to them.
They might be ahead of time and lack parental guidance.
The fetus in the womb planning is set to change as well.
The mother and father will co-plan the spirit journey before the fetus even enters the womb.
It will be light based planning from the outset while fully incarnate in this third density.
This is multidimensional living.
This is the great leap forward,
no offense to Mao Zedong.
He had the concept right.
It was the context he lacked.
A whole new human race is ready to step out of the chrysalis of time and spread its magnificent and colorful wings.
This is the promise



## Spacial Awareness

Physical movement entangles us with individual and collective consciousness,
oscillating between explicate and implicate.
We change environment and move through different levels of consciousness.
We alter the existing.
Our consciousness is acted upon by fluctuating fields of electromagnetic energy.
Epigenetics discovered our genes are made up of fifty percent DNA and fifty percent protein.
Genes are not self-actualizing.
The proteins comprise the structure of the human body,
defining shape and influencing behavior in an ongoing attempt to balance charge and polarity from the environment.

Our individual bubble of reality gets enriched in experience and memory through the journey on the celestial neural pathway.
We go from one hologram to another in the expansion we call the orchestra of consciousness.
The neural pathways are an assemblage of proteins that move the body and help it to function.
We all know how to walk through this reality.
The celestial mind generates the divine holograms through which our bodies have experience.
All living consciousness is part of the symphony.
The light and sound which creates and sustains all the realities allows us to manage a fractal of it which we call our reality.
Our very reality on an individual by individual basis is a co-created reality between us and the material of the hologram itself,
sound and light,
which sustains our physical and inner existence.
Our dreams are expressed in sound and light.
There are fractals within fractals.
Culture is another fractal,
whether it be a pueblo in a mountain village in Colombia,
or the frenetic consumerism inspired by Madison Avenue.
It's a hologram overlaying and interacting with your personal hologram.
It binds us to an era of history.
Our culture has Roman numeral time,
which is not our true accurate time stamp.
It may use elements of it,
though.
Our culture binds us to an era of history.
It's part of the hologram of resolution.
Our entanglement into the culture’s hologram of roman numeral time builds up a weave into the individual hologram.


Weather is an intricate part of our history,
part of what is going on at the time.
Weather is intraconnected to programmed water.
The programmed water of an era of history determines our weather patterns.
We as human beings are constantly imprinting on the water on an individual level to create a collective.
Animals and plants are conscious beings of choice,
even though they haven’t been given the rights,
duties,
or responsibilities of beings of awareness,
allowing the experience love.
Our laws don’t include them as part of that.
The rest of the network of life and our laws are separate from that through conscious entanglement with the narrative.
Trees,
plants….
anything that has consciousness and experiences life as part of the planet.
Our journey into the great awakening is knowing the network that is out there.
We are responsible not to step on the journeys of all the other things living here.
As part of the great awakening the ducks,
the dolphins,
the whales,
all of them are part of the awakening too.
It is not just solely for us humans.

CRYSTALS,
ROCKS are communities of beings that are part of it too.
We don’t have conscious awareness on how they interact with us even though it is our birth right and legacy of daily living.
CRYSTALS ARE part of the implicate/explicate order as they are SIMULTANEOUSLY entangled and unentangled.
We can imprint upon crystals ,
entangled narrative perceptions and agendas with our precognitive workforce.
A crystal will do what it needs to do for us based off how our precognitive workforce manifest the matter.
They are part of the ocean of awareness that becomes part of the sea of consciousness as animated matter.
The crystal allows you access to the ocean of awareness,
the sea of consciousness based off your capacity to perceive,
receive,
process and manifest it.
The crystalline structure is materialised,
no longer a fluid Ocean of Awareness or Sea of Consciousness.
When we enter 6th and 7th dimensions crystallisation is the lower end technology of generating matter based awareness.

FAIRIES: The things that are sightly out of phase with humanity,
the fairy kingdom,
the dwarfs and gnomes even though we can’t see them with our eyes,
they are still here and layered into the reality.
The SUN is what creates the fundamentals of time,
the passing of the seasons and the movement of the stars.
Roman Numeral time has tried to hijack our awareness of that to make it centric focus of its resolution.
At places of power that we are naturally attracted to,
where the veil between the layers of reality becomes thinner,
it is easier for our consciousness to have more capacity to perceive,
receive,
understand and interact with.
