================


Temporal manipulation started forty-eight to fifty-five thousand years ago.
Not all life forms practiced temporal manipulation.
It was about limiting the amount of life forms on the surface of the earth.
Particular DNA lineages were not receptive to this temporal manipulation.
We went from nine-hundred thousand different forms to one-hundred and thirty-five thousand.
This is the basis of DNA farming.
This is how they manipulate and limit who is going to be on the farm.

Q: How can we take back our temporal awareness and use it to our advantage? Getting our gut health back? Our micro organism in the gut,
that has a life span as part of the cojoined frequency that we are,
then generates a natural immune system in the blood,
through the marrow in the skeletal system.
The heart filters and processes that information together with the brain into higher levels of awareness to figure out what to do with our many agendas.
This will then also improve our intra and intercommunication.
Our capacity to connect to other temporal realms through dreamtime will increase through multiple points of temporal awareness.

Q: What other temporal realms are there? Your dream realm,
it has its own frequency of time and it is fair to say there are thousands of dream realms out there with thousands of different frequencies of time.
Your gut will basically have its own checklist of all the places it has been to and will be able to verify the temporal signature frequency,
meaning your gut will resonate with the frequency of being in the right time and space.
Most intuition comes from the gut and it depends on how the brain,
heart,
gut are connected.
Guthealth was ignored on purpose by conventional medicine,
death begins in the colon.

Q: How does EYE PATTERNS RECOGNITION fit into the concept of Consciousness Entanglement? Eye movements reflect on how we access,
perceive and process information in the consciousness field.
They are an indication if we are looking towards the future or the past.
We can use certain eye positions to access our memories and thoughts as well as create new ones and gain recognition on how to stay present,
outside of emotional entanglement.
Practicing those movements and positions allows the DNA instrument to gain more flexibility and access to the information in the conscious energy field.
