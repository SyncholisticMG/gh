## Temporal Highjacking

Temporal high jacking has been around since the dawn of time.
The whole point of it is to manipulate our capacity to time stamp.
Remember,
they discovered the infinite journey that the soul takes and then tried to figure out where,
when and how they could interfere or create an incoherent pattern to get a soul trapped in an era of history.
They could then generate a global narrative of mass distraction for the purpose of DNA Farming and hinder the *I am* consciousness to re-enter the Sea of Consciousness.

Q: Why choose the Thymus not use the Vagus nerve? This is time itself,
gut time vs heart time,
vs brain time,
versus unified gutbrainheart time.
For example when you are taking a multiple choice test in high school,
and you’ve got 50 questions to do in an hour you have roughly 1 min and 2 secs to answer each question.
That is the brain calculation of time.
The heart is obviously a part of that equation but it will only see the one hour as the potential of the experience.
The gut will be operating intuitively,
like can I give myself the best possible opportunity of having gut intuition during this span of time?
A third of all our central nervous pathways are in our gut,
a third in our heart and a third in our brain.
When you have all of them working together you have TEMPORAL AWARENESS with three forms of perception and perspective that can guide the many forms of consciousness through the journey of awareness.
The bodymindspirt as a complex being has many forms of awareness.
The foundation of temporal awareness that give us a calculation journey stem from the brain,
the heart and the gut.
They are the factors that check in with local reality time.
The gut,
the heart and the brain have a deep awareness of the energies that surround us as all electromagnetic frequencies are effected by their environment.
The Schumann Resonance is the background frequency of electromagnetics that is effected by solar winds and radiation,
the actual magnetics of the planet.
This is also how the celestial mind communicates to us and generates time in the temporal awareness.
It represents an opportunity for consciousness expansion.
If you feel that you respond to the spikes of the Schumann Resonance it might say to you that have all this electromagnetic thinking juice and you are not doing anything with it.

Q: When did Temporal Awareness manipulation start? Roughly 48-55,
000 years ago but not all the forms had it,
not all of them would take temporal manipulation that way.
Again,
it was all about limiting the amount of forms on the surface.
Something like you are not going to live on the surface because your particular DNA lineage won’t be receptive to this temporal awareness manipulation.
That’s why they went from 900,
000 different forms to 135,
000.
This is all about the basis of DNA farming and how they would manipulate and limit who was going to be in the farm.

Q: How can we take back our temporal awareness and use it to our advantage? Getting our gut health back? Our micro organism in the gut,
that has a life span as part of the cojoined frequency that we are,
then generates a natural immune system in the blood,
through the marrow in the skeletal system.
The heart filters and processes that information together with the brain into higher levels of awareness to figure out what to do with our many agendas.
This will then also improve our intra and intercommunication.
Our capacity to connect to other temporal realms through dreamtime will increase through multiple points of temporal awareness.

Q: What other temporal realms are there? Your dream realm,
it has its own frequency of time and it is fair to say there are thousands of dream realms out there with thousands of different frequencies of time.
Your gut will basically have its own checklist of all the places it has been to and will be able to verify the temporal signature frequency,
meaning your gut will resonate with the frequency of being in the right time and space.
Most intuition comes from the gut and it depends on how the brain,
heart,
gut are connected.
Guthealth was ignored on purpose by conventional medicine,
death begins in the colon.

Q: How does EYE PATTERNS RECOGNITION fit into the concept of Consciousness Entanglement? Eye movements reflect on how we access,
perceive and process information in the consciousness field.
They are an indication if we are looking towards the future or the past.
We can use certain eye positions to access our memories and thoughts as well as create new ones and gain recognition on how to stay present,
outside of emotional entanglement.
Practicing those movements and positions allows the DNA instrument to gain more flexibility and access to the information in the conscious energy field.
