## Self Mastery

Part of self-mastery is learning about what our internal agenda is,
how we can change it through mastery,
so we can explore all the possibilities available.
When we activate our crown chakra,
we activate a million Aurora Borealis and the dream frequency.
When we are expelling from our rectum
&mdash;
the opposite of the third eye
&mdash;
we excrete the negative dream frequencies.


The amount of energy behind a memory to be manifested from a dream has a certain limitation.
Sometimes the amplitude,
the maximum vibration,
is very high but the frequency isnâ€™t.
When we wake up,
we can add charge and amplitude to it so it becomes manifested.
The nervous system plays a part in short circuiting the memory process.
It's downloaded in the DNA but not always highlighted well,
making it hard to find.


Algorithms are a continuous infinite string of perceptions and numbers in which a DNA instrument of experience processes into many different colors of time and space.
A human being is a data processing machine.
The skinsuit we wear is the technology.
The dream world provides for the infinite energy to come into the body to be processed and manifested.
We are here to experience NOW,
we are clearing the past,
to start experiencing the overlay of past,
present,
future in the moment of now.


The Western doorway of perception opens up for us to see,
feel,
and know where our dreams need to be placed.
We have a cellular memory stored in the body.
The skeleton is the biggest data storage device we have.
Our skull has a crystalline structure within where our dreams and heart memories are stored.
The brain is our access machine to use it.
There are times we're in an intense dream,
we come out of it,
and there's a fullness.
Our data buffer is full.
We then move that information to another part of our body.
After some years in a life we have them stored all over the body.
This is why we go through sudden remembrances at times.
We think of a person,
the cellular memory becomes active.
It's triggered.
Information needs to be put back in its place.
It happens when code has gotten so long it makes the system run slow.
A human being is a data processing machine.
The skinsuit that we wear is the technology.
The dream world is the infinite energy.
The finite energy comes into the body.
Where we cross over from our dreamworld to the physical world is where we learn the mechanics of how dreams are stored.
