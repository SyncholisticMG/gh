## Dreamtime Awakening


The original purpose of earth is extraordinary.
This gem of a planet was linked with the dream mind of all solar systems so all karma could be resolved in the dreaming mind of earth.
It became a beacon for the lost
&mdash;
beings who were on their home worlds or their astral worlds found a rainbow gateway to earth.
They were drawn because they could dream and regain their akashic identity.
We on earth are connected to all dreaming minds of this universe.
Our only limitation is our creativity.
The more creative we are the more infinite we are.

We're still creating karma,
but it’s not an infinite amount.
No matter what we create,
it won’t reach the infinite state again.
Think of it as additional time in a football game,
no one knows when it's going to end and we are on shoot outs.
The galactic ascension machine has finished and we've created a zero sum game for them.
Domination and control cannot out-create the seven plus billion humans.
It's done.
Choose to step out of the hologram.
Focus onto your bubble of reality and dreamtime.
Whatever creates joy and abundance for you are the new energies of creation in the now.
There is a sense of entitlement in the spiritual communities that's misleading.
This is an individual awakening.
We have to create our own bubbles of reality,
hold our own frequencies,
shed our old skins.


There exist dreamtime societies.
They connect us to the universal mind to improve our evolution as universal beings.
They don’t operate by borders.
They use portals and synapses to bring information from other dimensions and worlds.
They operate by signature frequency to create the connections,
separations,
societies,
and synchronicities that concatenate other synchronicities into a theme.
There are languages everywhere,
and there are languages in the dreamtime.

Every set of themes correlates to a step in our evolution.
Dreamtime societies help capable souls go on potent dreamtime journeys
&mdash;
tens of thousands of places simultaneously to expand dreamtime capacity.
There is a dreamtime for our villages,
cities,
and countries.
Every group we are a part of,
from the most personal to the most impersonal,
are part of our karmic script in an incarnation.
This means there are certain lessons everyone in the group must experience.
There is karma to being a surname Singh,
a karma to the region of Punjab the family is staked,
a karma to being a Sikh,
and so on and so forth.
The same is true for a Texan Christian.
There is a dreamtime for all resonant energy of that variant of Christianity in that part of Texas.
If we are born into it we resonate with it and we enter its dreamtime.
We also have a dreamtime for the human race.
When we travel in our dreams we carry the earth signature in our frequency.
Some of us dream in even larger realms.
When we're really good at dreamtime travel we go into the hollow earth,
the dreaming body of earth,
where we achieve a dream state in which we invite other societies from other places,
spaces,
and frequencies in time to be part of the hub of interconnectivity.


We can’t choose who we travel with when we haven’t achieved full sovereignty in our dreamworld,
but we aren't limited to what our society tells us.
We can claim our sleep time and not be affected our nation’s borders.
Revocations only go so far to get we out of mediocrity and then we need to create beyond probably not just in language but art work,
with fire and s.
Joy is the main river,
allow the synchronicities to flow.


Certain dreamtime societies help us evolve by going to our next level
&mdash;
dreaming in many places at once.
The purpose is to prove it as a soul,
that we can do it,
and the *I am* is the direct manifestation that the universe has happened.
It's to validate the great dreamtime awakening for other dreamtime societies who've lost faith it's coming
&mdash;
a multitude of residual images and emotions calling for remedy and resolve.
Some residual images need a residual time.
That’s why many of them feel layered over.
The time gaps are synchronistic manifestations of multiple time frequencies in a dream.
That’s the uni-world of all forms of thoughts,
concepts,
and perceptions layered atop each other.
Different timelines are not dependent on each other.
They're each a product of themselves.




We can use dreams to resolve karma.
We can install dharma by commencing the frequency where karma can no longer hold us back,
where we are propelled into creating dharma.
We can make manifest in the dreamworld.
We can create a solidified memory,
a tangible mind space process where we make tangible dream weave frequencies in the photonic light memories we work with.
To do this we have to let go of control and expectations.
Dream energies can get stuck in the intestinal tract.
If we can’t remember our dreams this is often a clue.

The world is in our face so much our dream frequency isn't allowed to percolate more of our awareness.
It's important we have a disciplined approach before we go to sleep and before we wake up
&mdash;
those ten minutes before we get up are ours.
It can be the greatest potency of discipline to reclaim ourselves,
saying no to our parasympathetic,
instantly ripping us out of theta into the alpha state.
We can also choose to go back to sleep,
back to the dream.
We've been sharing dreams since before there was a society.


We're all part of earth’s dream.
We don’t live in her dreaming body.
She’s got her own.
We live on her physical body,
but she's simultaneously dreaming with every living being to create a physical body.
When we choose to be part of our dreamworld and engage with different dreamtime communities,
organizations,
and societies on the surface world,
we become part of earth's mid-theta and high-theta dream frequency.
When we reach the next level,
where we work high quality dream frequencies and go on missions.
We work with the astral dream world to create a benefit for the seven past and seven future generations,
then,
ultimately
we're dreaming with the celestial dream time society and we go into the hollow earth,
the dreaming body of earth,
where she achieves a dream state and invites other societies from other places,
spaces,
and frequencies in time to be part of the hub of interconnectivity
&mdash;
mother earth dreaming with many other planets simultaneously.
Her dreaming body is in the inner earth.
We get access to it when we have done our due diligence and self mastery work.
When we enter the lucid dreaming state as awakening beings,
we can make powerful manifestations within ourselves and the energies around us.
The state of mother earth’s dreaming body is perfect.
There is no need to project unhealthiness onto the earth.
