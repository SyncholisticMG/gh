## Dreamtime Awakening


The original purpose of earth is extraordinary.
This gem of a planet was linked with the dream mind of all solar systems so all karma could be resolved in the dreaming mind of earth.
It became a beacon for the lost
&mdash;
beings who were on their home worlds or their astral worlds found a rainbow gateway to earth.
They were drawn because they could dream and regain their akashic identity.
We on earth are connected to all dreaming minds of this universe.
Our only limitation is our creativity.
The more creative we are the more infinite we are.

We're still creating karma,
but it’s not an infinite amount.
No matter what we create,
it won’t reach the infinite state again.
Think of it as additional time in a football game,
no one knows when it's going to end and we are on shoot outs.
The galactic ascension machine has finished and we've created a zero sum game for them.
Domination and control cannot out-create the seven plus billion humans.
It's done.
Choose to step out of the hologram.
Focus onto your bubble of reality and dreamtime.
Whatever creates joy and abundance for you are the new energies of creation in the now.
There is a sense of entitlement in the spiritual communities that's misleading.
This is an individual awakening.
We have to create our own bubbles of reality,
hold our own frequencies,
shed our old skins.


There exist dreamtime societies.
They connect us to the universal mind to improve our evolution as universal beings.
They don’t operate by borders.
They use portals and synapses to bring information from other dimensions and worlds.
They operate by signature frequency to create the connections,
separations,
societies,
and synchronicities that concatenate other synchronicities into a theme.
There are languages everywhere,
and there are languages in the dreamtime.

Every set of themes correlates to a step in our evolution.
Dreamtime societies help capable souls go on potent dreamtime journeys
&mdash;
tens of thousands of places simultaneously to expand dreamtime capacity.
There is a dreamtime for our villages,
cities,
and countries.
Every group we are a part of,
from the most personal to the most impersonal,
are part of our karmic script in an incarnation.
This means there are certain lessons everyone in the group must experience.
There is karma to being a surname Singh,
a karma to the region of Punjab the family is staked,
a karma to being a Sikh,
and so on and so forth.
The same is true for a Texan Christian.
There is a dreamtime for all resonant energy of that variant of Christianity in that part of Texas.
If we are born into it we resonate with it and we enter its dreamtime.
We also have a dreamtime for the human race.
When we travel in our dreams we carry the earth signature in our frequency.
Some of us dream in even larger realms.
When we're really good at dreamtime travel we go into the hollow earth,
the dreaming body of earth,
where we achieve a dream state in which we invite other societies from other places,
spaces,
and frequencies in time to be part of the hub of interconnectivity.
