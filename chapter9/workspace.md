## Out of Body

In an out of body experience we come out of our heart,
our third eye,
and our crown.
We have a cord attached to our crown.
It's very different than the dreaming experience.
Remote viewing is a tiny sample of what's possible now.
Part of we is in the North and South Pole,
the past and the future When we are remote viewing,
we are extending our photonic light expressions.
Wer power is to control our dreaming body,
that means where we belly button,
two inches above and below,
literally in our intestinal tract.
This is how our DNA skinsuit was set up,
it's a dreaming skinsuit but it has a time sensitive spirit inside it.

Q: What is a rebellious dreaming body?
A rebellious dreaming body can be when we are going into sacred geometry cities,
through backdoors to relationships that went toxic,
to alter time frames to heal them.
All the orders that we have been taking in the physical as well as the dreamworld we must destroy them.
These are the things we need to remove from our dreaming body so that the power of our dreaming body is returned to we so when we go to sleep as the I am presence we are telling the dreaming body,
we are not dreaming in these places but we are going to the places of our true soul family and we are going to have a soul family reunion.
This is my will of the *I am* presence and the way of the now.
The body at times gets cocky and thinks it's the soul and the soul spark is the experience.
It's the other way round.

Q: Taking oneâ€™s power back from the Dreaming Body?
Salt baths,
talking to the fire,
any of the tools and techniques we have in our spiritual hygiene toolbox apply them to all the dream times we were forced to conform.
Find those times in our life where we chose conformity over authentic expression.
Often our dreaming body is making we conform.
Toxicity can be a  debt,
that was created by others,
which we don't need to take on.
For the true human potential to be understood we must conquer our own spiritual,
physical,
social,
technological,
dreamtime toxicity.
We must stop paying attention to Roman Numeral Time and know that we exist in a notime reality.
Our skinsuits have skill sets,
clairvoyance,
clairaudience,
clairsentients,
telekinesis,
aerokinesis,
pyrokinesis and a thousand others yet to describe.
We co-function in many worlds simultaneously and the disciplines of how is our inherent legacy.
Say to our dreaming body: WE ARE COMING INTO UNITY,
NEUTRALITY,
NO MORE REBELLION,
IT IS TIME TO COME HOME AND WORK TOGETHER IN CREATING OUR LEGACY
Q: How can we achieve a goal through LUCID DREAMING?
By entering the lucid state and training the spirit body to have a much higher flow.
Upon awakening from that lucid state,
begin the movement process and then return to that lucid state,
engaging the mind space to have the lucidity of the infinite dreamworld.
Intense clarity comes in those lucid moments where new science and concepts can be perceived.
Lucidity means do we have the fullness of our choice points in our dreamworld.
We will never have full control over it as our sleep paralysis represents a limiting factor.
When we go into a natural sleep paralysis to enter the theta,
delta state to have the fullness of the dream we are engaging the dreaming vehicle,
where the *I am* presences removes itself from the seat of the power and the brain and the heart connects to the fullness of the DNA and moves from the heart into the intestinal tract and engages the dreaming vehicle to perceive and interact with the dreaming world.
THE PHYSICAL BODY IS STILL PART OF IT.
Lucidity is about engaging the physical body in the sleep paralysis so that the chemical process is undone and the mystical energy is flowing through the blood.
That is how we are able to do those masterful things.
Understanding lucidity will be seeing the blood in the body flowing through its process and empowering it with the thought construct of running faster.
