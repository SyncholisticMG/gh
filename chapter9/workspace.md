## Totems

Totem guides,
animal medicine,
and spirit guides assist us to communicate with those worlds.
We speak form our heart.
Our mind is in perfect sink with our heart during the infinite moment our heart is connected to the spirit world.
In the fetus of the womb,
the very first thing that comes forward is our heart.
In the heart is a piece of brain matter,
the very first concept of our brain.
As our body expands we make a spinal column and a head.
The heart separates into two.
The new brain is formed by the time the baby reaches twenty to thirty weeks.

Our dreaming body lives in our organs,
between the root sacral chakra and just a little bit above,
it does not exist in our head.
When we begin to enter a dream state,
we drop the three top chakras into the solar plexus.
The human body turns off and goes into sleep paralysis.
LUCID DREAMING is when all the upper chakras are in the sacral chakra building up this wave pattern before going into the root.
This is where we have the sacred,
mental moment where we say I want to lucid dream.
This is how we battle the programming,
the autopilot.
All our consciousness into the root,
blossoming like a flower,
opening over and over and like the Mandelbrot send creates a prism of energy.
Like a crystal reflecting the light,
that is the beginning of our dreamstate.
At the very beginning of our dreamstate is where we set the rules of how we want to remember,
we have total control over our cellular memory at that point.

It's the time where the programmer comes in and says,
the pain in my back needs to be healed and we can now work on our relationship with off world.
Once the root chakra has been programmed  it comes up and we have dream travel,
where we enter dreamtime,
dreamworlds,
where we look to our cellular memories,
dreamtime maps,
dreamtime compass,
that allows we to see the dreamtime houses that are out there so we may project our dreamtime body to these thoughts and experience all these thoughts with all of our mind.

Q: What is it when people show up on our dreams?
When people show up in our dreams two things are happening.
It's a self-revelation dream where our own self has recreated a residual image of something or somebody that is meant for a specific teaching or we are sharing actual dream space with that person.
It usually is the first and otherwise we are not sharing a reality but an expression of an experiental body that is out of phase with the *I am* presence self.
That is going through higher levels of consciousness exploration in the dreamworld and somehow the body must have a memory of it.
Most people are disconnected and cannot remember their dreams.
The energy of the dream space is residually there and we can correlate it around our heart and sacrum and create mystical experiences in the future.
YOU ARE A TRAVELLER ENERGY.

There are times where we become very loving,
we go and visit beings that are under attack and love them and get attached then that spiritual body becomes bloated and that love energy and the other physical body won’t have enough love energy as that spiritual body.
We become a litter stalkerish of that other love person until they get attacked again and then we have that burst energy.
Over amorous love energy for other non-physical entities at times or physical entities but we are only experiencing them non-physically and we are experiencing their traumas and pains and rapidly defending them.
In order to heal that we have to align ourselves to the center of our heart,
detox the aura each day and improve on our spiritual hygiene.

Q: When we talk about the DREAMWEAVE what do we mean?
In our dreamworlds we are going to different bubbles of time realities and recalibrate and weaving together all different times,
our dreaming mind is overworking.
We can’t remember all these dreams because they are so vast and as a micro being going through the awakening where the third eye,
becomes a part of the heart again,
so we can learn through heart and mind based expression of duality.
We experience is about calibrating time so that people can go into re-alignment that means in our physical life there would have  been phases where we go through something and then a fuse would be lit and then it would be over then we start the next fuse and it would be over and we haven’t finished the process of deeply self-nurturing our self.
It's always advisable to disentangle from where we got caught in the trap of false time and light.
Karmic retrobuting souls are those that give away their power to the system.
Karmic resolvers,
contributors,
creators and incarnators don't have any karma when they come in.
Soul unity is where all our shards are integrated using the same frequency of dreamtime.

Q: What happens when we are not getting accurate dream sleep?
Wer dreaming body has taken up much more space and sovereignty then it should have.
This means we don’t go the full 40 or 50 min or two hours hours that it takes to build up the proper energy that it takes for our body to get ready to leave in a proper way.
There are times where the dreaming body just kicks we into sleep paralysis to leave as soon as possible by taking its mission far too seriously.
It ignores the heart or it doesn’t leave until it gets answers out of the brain.
Our dreaming bodies have their own mission,
separate from us but those missions ultimately affect the frequencies of the people we love,
hate,
need and all those things in between.
We are our own teachers,
and the dreaming bodies are in the future in their own expression of time that is layered over the IAM presence existence that is not there yet.

We are the *I am* Apex presence,
here and now for the experience,
that includes the sleep experience.
Taking the sovereignty back form the dreamworld,
so that we get proper dream nurturing,
wake up with a spark in our eyes.
Even if we don’t remember the dream but we wake up refreshed,
like it was twelve hours  asleep that lasted five minutes.
It's ok to demand from our dreaming body to change the frequency pattern.
We need to preserve enough energy to detect entities,
have synchronicities,
mystical experiences.
We’ve got to begin to recover our energy,
look at our sleep patterns.
Salt baths,
the dreaming body might resist,
we are going into neutrality with that salt.

Q: Can we say a bit on the dreaming experience versus an out of body experience and remote viewing?
In an OBE we come out of our heart,
our third eye and our crown we have a cord attached to our crown,
it's a very different experience to the dreaming experience.
Remote viewing is just one tiny sample of what is possible now.
Part of we is in the North and South Pole,
the past and the future When we are remote viewing,
we are extending our photonic light expressions.
Wer power is to control our dreaming body,
that means where we belly button,
two inches above and below,
literally in our intestinal tract.
This is how our DNA skinsuit was set up,
it's a dreaming skinsuit but it has a time sensitive spirit inside it.

Q: What is a rebellious dreaming body?
A rebellious dreaming body can be when we are going into sacred geometry cities,
through backdoors to relationships that went toxic,
to alter time frames to heal them.
All the orders that we have been taking in the physical as well as the dreamworld we must destroy them.
These are the things we need to remove from our dreaming body so that the power of our dreaming body is returned to we so when we go to sleep as the I am presence we are telling the dreaming body,
we are not dreaming in these places but we are going to the places of our true soul family and we are going to have a soul family reunion.
This is my will of the *I am* presence and the way of the now.
The body at times gets cocky and thinks it's the soul and the soul spark is the experience.
It's the other way round.

Q: Taking one’s power back from the Dreaming Body?
Salt baths,
talking to the fire,
any of the tools and techniques we have in our spiritual hygiene toolbox apply them to all the dream times we were forced to conform.
Find those times in our life where we chose conformity over authentic expression.
Often our dreaming body is making we conform.
Toxicity can be a  debt,
that was created by others,
which we don't need to take on.
For the true human potential to be understood we must conquer our own spiritual,
physical,
social,
technological,
dreamtime toxicity.
We must stop paying attention to Roman Numeral Time and know that we exist in a notime reality.
Our skinsuits have skill sets,
clairvoyance,
clairaudience,
clairsentients,
telekinesis,
aerokinesis,
pyrokinesis and a thousand others yet to describe.
We co-function in many worlds simultaneously and the disciplines of how is our inherent legacy.
Say to our dreaming body: WE ARE COMING INTO UNITY,
NEUTRALITY,
NO MORE REBELLION,
IT IS TIME TO COME HOME AND WORK TOGETHER IN CREATING OUR LEGACY
Q: How can we achieve a goal through LUCID DREAMING?
By entering the lucid state and training the spirit body to have a much higher flow.
Upon awakening from that lucid state,
begin the movement process and then return to that lucid state,
engaging the mind space to have the lucidity of the infinite dreamworld.
Intense clarity comes in those lucid moments where new science and concepts can be perceived.
Lucidity means do we have the fullness of our choice points in our dreamworld.
We will never have full control over it as our sleep paralysis represents a limiting factor.
When we go into a natural sleep paralysis to enter the theta,
delta state to have the fullness of the dream we are engaging the dreaming vehicle,
where the *I am* presences removes itself from the seat of the power and the brain and the heart connects to the fullness of the DNA and moves from the heart into the intestinal tract and engages the dreaming vehicle to perceive and interact with the dreaming world.
THE PHYSICAL BODY IS STILL PART OF IT.
Lucidity is about engaging the physical body in the sleep paralysis so that the chemical process is undone and the mystical energy is flowing through the blood.
That is how we are able to do those masterful things.
Understanding lucidity will be seeing the blood in the body flowing through its process and empowering it with the thought construct of running faster.
