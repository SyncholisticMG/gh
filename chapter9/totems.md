## Totems

Totem guides,
animal medicine,
and spirit guides assist us to communicate with those worlds.
We speak form our heart.
Our mind is in perfect sink with our heart during the infinite moment our heart is connected to the spirit world.
In the fetus of the womb,
the very first thing that comes forward is our heart.
In the heart is a piece of brain matter,
the very first concept of our brain.
As our body expands we make a spinal column and a head.
The heart separates into two.
The new brain is formed by the time the baby reaches twenty to thirty weeks.

Our dreaming body lives in our organs,
between the root sacral chakra and a little bit above.
It doesn't exist in our head.
When we enter a dream state,
we drop the three top chakras into the solar plexus.
The human body turns off and goes into sleep paralysis.
Lucid dreaming happens when all the upper chakras are in the sacral chakra,
building up a wave pattern before going into the root.
This is where we have the sacred,
mental moment where we say I want to lucid dream.
This is how we battle the programming.
The beginning of our dream state is when we set the rules of how we want to remember.
We have total control over our cellular memory at that point.


When people show up in our dreams two things are happening
&mdash;
it's a self-revelation dream in which we have recreated a residual image of something or someone meant for a specific teaching,
or we're sharing actual dream space with the other person.
Most people are disconnected and cannot remember their dreams.
The energy of the dream space is residual and there,
and we can correlate it around our heart and sacrum and create mystical experiences in the future.
We are a traveler energy.
We can’t remember all our dreams.
They're so vast.


Our dream body has taken up much more space and sovereignty than it should have.
We don’t the proper energy to leave in a proper way.
Our dreaming bodies have their own missions,
separate from us,
but their missions ultimately affect the frequencies of the people we love,
hate,
need,
and everything in between.
We are our own teachers.
Our dream bodies go out into time,
like an advance recon force,
and layer over the *I am* presence existence not yet there.

We are the *I am* apex presence,
here and now for the experience,
including the sleep experience.
We need to preserve enough energy to detect entities,
have synchronicities,
and mystical experiences.
