echnological Uncertainties

The objective was a cold-stamping process for two different aluminum brackets (#3544 and #3557) containing a fully-formed conical screw boss stamped from a flat sheet. Conventionally, bosses of this type were either cast or welded. Technological unknowns included:

• The number of hits required to push material into the full depth of the boss;
• Whether the surrounding material was sufficient to feed the boss without thinning or tearing;
• How to ensure that the inner hole of the boss was a smooth surface suitable for tapping.


In FY2014, Anderdon encountered additional obstacles related to both sets of tooling:

Part Shift (#3544)

Since the blank was perfectly flat (i.e., a single plane), it shifted position in the dies, causing poor location of the bosses and gainer pockets (pre-strain bubbles).

Problems with Lubrication and Slug Removal (#3544)

Upward boss extrusions were not normally done in the industry. Gravity made it difficult to keep lubrication (applied upwardly) in the boss area between forming stages. Since experiments with various wet and dry lubes had failed in FY2013, Anderdon needed to reduce friction and extend the operating life of the vertical punches. Also, the upward extrusion precluded conventional slug removal solutions.

Extension to Progressive Die System (#3544)

Anderdon wanted the ability to form these parts in a progressive (“prog”) die system as a low-cost, high-volume alternative to the transfer die. However, in a prog system, there was no ability to re-align parts along favorable grain lines between stages. For part #3544, a single orientation of the blank remained throughout all stamping stages. No solution was known to overcome the inevitable forming issues that Anderdon faced to develop the boss extrusion in a prog die system.

Over-Thinning (#3557)

The geometry of the other bracket (#3557) allowed its boss to be formed downward. While this simplified the slug removal process, the large M10 boss extrusion process was a challenge to form out of thinner 2.5mm material. It was uncertain whether this was too thin to feed the boss area, while avoiding over-thinning and tearing of the material surrounding the boss and voids in the boss walls.

Attempts to Control Part Shift (#3544)

The screw bosses needed a very accurate location for a later threading operation (and eventually for assembly to the vehicle frame). Therefore, Anderdon had to devise a methodology to hold the blank firmly and consistently.

On the transfer die set, Anderdon experimented by milling a trough around the perimeter of the blank and inserting a piece of 0.01” inch steel, in hopes of raising the blank and having it act as a guide to locate it more accurately, without shifting before or during the pressing process. In addition, a light spring ejector pin was implemented to eliminate ‘part jump’ during transfer. Different spring rates had to be tested to achieve the lift needed without causing the part to jump.

Experiments with Lubrication and Slug Removal (#3544)

Anderdon needed to find a lubricant and/or tool steel coating that could withstand the high frictional wear on the boss punch caused by the aluminum. They also needed to devise a way to remove the pierced aluminum slugs from the top of the part.

Upward lubrication of the boss surface was not working. Traditionally, lubrication was applied between transfer stages. Access was difficult and cycle time suffered. Therefore, Anderdon hypothesized that if lubrication lines could run through the die and inject lube directly on the boss surfaces, local application of lubricant would counteract the tendency for gravity to pull the fluid away. However, this was an unproven concept as the dies needed adequate wall thickness along a path from the exterior to the interior application point. In addition, Anderdon had to develop the external pump and line design, as it had to function without pinching in the press and without fatiguing through repeated cycling.

In addition, a vacuum system was designed to remove the slug punched out of the boss hole. The necessary vacuum pressure and positioning of the vacuum nozzle tip were unknown. Early trials showed a variation in where the slug would land and its ultimate orientation, so the initial vacuum tube was increased in size to encompass a larger area around the boss. However, the wider tube did not generate enough vacuum to consistently remove the slug. If a slug remained behind, it could get caught in the die and damage the tooling and subsequent parts. A series of smaller tube diameters were trialed where each one was polished on the interior surface to minimize the flow restriction and maximize vacuum. The final size could not be predicted analytically as the slugs varied in location, orientation, shape and exit speed after being punched out. The trial data was analyzed, from which the final tube geometry was selected.

While direct lubrication of the boss area helped boss formation, the hole-puncher was still experiencing premature wear. Although the aluminum being punched is a much softer material, it had a high coefficient of friction with tool steel and tended to adhere to the punch surfaces. Anderdon ran numerous experiments to test different coatings on the punch surface. While most of the coatings improved durability, none of them performed ideally. The combination of a coated punch and internal direct lubrication was far superior to the original manual lube application between stages. The long-term durability of this solution will be monitored if these concepts get used in production.

Extension to Progressive Die System (#3544)

Early trials of the initial prog die design demonstrated that parts were not being held into place rigidly enough. Since a trivial solution (e.g., widening the carrier) was not possible and was unlikely to work, Anderdon sought an alternative method to secure the parts more rigidly in their intended position.

Since the part and its grain orientation could not be realigned for each stage, like in the transfer die system, the gainer pocket could not be formed in only one or two hits. Instead, experiments were run which determined that no fewer than three hits were needed to form the same pocket in a prog die system in order to avoid wrinkles and tears.

Experiments to Counteract Over-Thinning (#3557)

If the part thinned too much and became weakened, Anderdon would have to devise a way to strengthen the part without changing its geometry. Also, gainer pockets in the aluminum were galling on the surface and Anderdon needed to find a solution to eliminate it from occurring.

The die system for #3557 had components that required the part to be re-orientated in order to achieve the proper final geometry. In particular, the part had four “legs” that had to finish with distinct, precise angles for accurate attachment to the vehicle structure. This final stamping stage required the manoeuvrability of a traditional transfer press. Therefore, the #3557 stamping process was a hybrid combination of a prog die system followed by a transfer die system (or a “trog” system, as it was dubbed).

The legs of the part were over-thinned at their bending radii, resulting in incorrect leg angles. Anderdon experimented by adding darts on the edges with radii, in order to make them more rigid; however, this was insufficient. The company also experimented with various heat treating processes in an attempt to increase their strength. However, all heat treatments that were tested produced inconsistencies, as the cold work-hardening in the bend and dart areas relaxed. This resulted in flexing of the leg angles as the heat ramped up and then cooled. This remained an unresolved issue for the next fiscal year (FY2015).

Start of Section 246 - Advancements

In FY2014, experimental development activities enabled Anderdon to advance its knowledge base in the following ways:

• Experimental trials led to the development of an internal die lubrication system that could deliver localized lubrication without compromising tool wall thickness.

• The necessary process parameters for a reliable vacuum slug removal system were determined through experimentation.

• Anderdon also learned how to coat steel punches for piercing aluminum to extend punch life.

• They also learned how to combine prog and transfer die systems to form complex parts, in addition to controlling the specific effects of various heat treatments on wing angle deflection.
