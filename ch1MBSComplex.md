Space-time is an infinite set of co-ordinates atop existence.
We live in a reality defined by experience.  
We tell stories.
They have a beginning,
a middle,
and an end.
We chronicle our stories.
The first person who ever took pen to paper did so in fear,
and this is why human beings are enmeshed in stories.
We love the drama.
We love to create it,
and we love to consume it.
Drama is tension.
Human beings say they want peace,
but it's kind of a scam when you're honest.
If we wanted peace we wouldn't create tension in our lives,
but without the tension we can't live the drama.
It's best just to be honest.
If you lie about it you're more susceptible to programming,
which proliferates the world,
hundreds of broadcast networks and movie studios all over the world
&mdash;
Hollywood,
Bollywood,
Hong Kong,
Shanghai,
the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation,
British Broadcasting Corporation,
and too many more to list
&mdash;
all servicing humanity's insatiable appetite for programming,
which is drama for the most part,
which,
as we have clearly established,
is tension.
Yet,
if you walk up to any human being and ask them if they prefer peace to tension they will tell you they prefer peace.
Isn't that strange?


It really isn't that strange when you understand what's going on down here.
On the spiral ladder of our deoxyribonucleic acid
&mdash;
DNA by its affectionate abbreviation
&mdash;
we hold an evolving marker of our place in time-space which also represents our level of consciousness.
This marker is the sum of our *experience*
&mdash;
where experience is movement in time-space,
and the drama,
the tension,
we create
&mdash;
and represents but a faction of our greater soul,
and the experiences we have assimilated as a soul faction.


This marker is directly aligned with our level of responsibility because our level of consciousness is always equal to our level of responsibility.
They are in a symbiotic relationship,
consciousness and responsibility.
DNA is in essence coordinates to where we fit in space-time,
or,
to stay with our narrative,
how we've been *written into* the story.
Our circumstance is our DNA,
which is our story,
which is our tension,
which is our drama,
which we wrote and act out ourselves,
forgetting the author sleeps in our unconscious.

We have the story,
creation,
and we have the author,
God and soul as a fractal of God,
or the prime creator,
as God is so anthropomorphically programmed into human consciousness as a being like us
&mdash;
two arms and legs,
two eyes and ears,
bipedal,
and fond of long white beards
&mdash;
and we have the actor,
soul as well,
incarnate
&mdash;
sheathed really
&mdash;
in this body,
borrowed from air,
earth,
water,
fire,
and ether.


The travail of the soul is to unlock levels of consciousness.
It is a travail because we must suffer for it.
New consciousness permits us to embody new experiences,
to write,
direct,
and star in a more expanded story.

So why a hologram,
and,
more importantly,
why a divine hologram?
It's a hologram because it is light projected into a three dimensional manifestation.
It's divine because the light comes from the prime creator,
God.
When we use the word hologram we get an idea of something mechanistic,
of some malicious tinker on the other side of reality making it,
and,
therefore,
it's all fake,
a simulation,
and therefore we are the victim of something.
Nothing could be further from the truth,
unless we can victimize ourselves,
which we can and we do,
because drama needs tension,
and tension is stress,
and volunteering for stress by manufactured tension is masochistic.
By calling it a hologram,
with all the mechanistic undertone,
we make an object of our reality,
something acting against us,
a god,
a devil,
an angel,
a demon,
anything but ourselves.
This is why we objectify our reality.
This is why we call it a simulation,
a matrix,
a hologram.
It's a lack of consciousness,
a failure to attribute the divine to the light,
and a stone deaf ear to the word,
which is the sound which is the light,
sustaining all the worlds in this sound and light manifestation.
It's funny,
because when you clue into it;
it's everywhere.

```
She should have died hereafter.
There would have been a time for such a word.
Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow
Creeps in this petty pace from day to day
To the last syllable of recorded time.
And all our yesterdays have lighted fools
The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle.
Life’s but a walking shadow, a poor player
That struts and frets his hour upon the stage,
And then is heard no more. It is a tale
Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,
Signifying nothing.

Macbeth
William Shakespeare

```

Why would the end of time be marked and measured by syllables?
Because it's all sound,
and light is a form of sound.
This is,
of course,
why we have so much tonal prayer and trance,
whether it be Sufi dervishes spinning to an intoxicating Arabic song-like prayer,
heavy on chanting,
the persistence of mantra in yoga and meditation,
long vowel sounds drawn out on the breath,
or the deep throat singing of the Mongols,
which,
they say,
allows them to speak to their ancestors,
and Gregorian chanting in the Christian tradition.
It's all about the sounds.

There are so many creation stories.
The garden of Eden and the rather horrid unfolding of Genesis,
the incredible tales of the turtle universe from the Iroquois Confederacy in Canada,
or the novel,
post-modern *school room of soul* narrative the new age favors.
They're all versions of the same story.
One of the more recent
&mdash;
only five hundred years ago
&mdash;
is the Anurag Sagar,
orated by an illiterate weaver named Kabir Sahib,
a satguru
&mdash;
which means *true teacher*
&mdash;
of his time.
He ups the game big time.
He introduces a creation story where God willed everything into existence with seventeen shabdas
&mdash;
sound currents
&mdash;
that animate all the dimensions and sub-dimensions that weave together reality.
It's an incredibly precise addition to creation mythologies,
and certainly the forebearer of all notions of at least a great many of our dimensions being simulations of sorts.
Hence the divine hologram,
which is the metaphor for creation used here,
in this instance,
a literal metaphor.
It's true both figuratively and literally.
The seventeen shabdas originate from a place that itself has no sound,
but is not silent,
and no light,
but is not dark,
the final riddle from the illiterate weaver.


We are not actuality creating anything in time.
We are traversing it and enjoining an experience with it.
We are seedlings in a cosmic garden,
passing through experiences expressed in a specific form of life,
and then,
when sentience is achieved alongside language and culture,
we go through any number of human expressions until we master the tool,
the *hu man* form,
a rather extraordinary instrument,
as maligned as it has become in the *First World*,
the newer,
better hu* man* that seems just around the corner,
the *trans-hu-man*,
the super man made from man,
Nietzsche's bastard let loose upon the world
&mdash;
nonetheless,
a rather extraordinary instrument,
the *hu man* form.
We are inside a sound and light reality,
one of many,
and we traverse and enjoin experience with it,
unaware we're inside it,
until,
by epiphany,
the nature of the system reveals itself in form.
The story was written before we lived it,
even though it seemed like it was really happening for the longest of times.
We are living the mapped out keys of the experiences.
Every choice,
path,
and set of functions,
every different type of life has been made available to us so we can embody the experience,
mapped like a script,
written into what we perceive to be a timeline,
a bloodline,
a clan,
a tribe,
a culture,
a people,
a place,
a planet
&mdash;
stories within stories,
managed by cosmic editors and keepers of time,
all under a prime creator,
an amorphous but fully conscious presence in everything we call life,
unconditionally offering the experiences as an expression of its love.
You believe as much already if you follow a prophetic religion.
The prophets tell of a a story already written.


Do not diminish your position as a living and sentient being.
You are creating within this world.
Your free will choices unfold the story.
As the story unfolds,
you receive the blessings of the particular experience.
Never feel overwhelmed or helpless.
We are truly connected to the outcome of our unique choices.
As we get further into this journey,
we realize we're time traveling beings by nature.
In no way is this experience linear.
We are responsible for our creations forwards and backwards in time,
and we can make alterations as we see fit
&mdash;
when our consciousness is so unfolded
&mdash;
by connecting to past and future versions of ourselves.



## One

Eternity is in the present moment,
mediated,
through attention and awareness,
by perception and perspective,
until we leave the celestial sphere,
then,
a new swath of perception opens.
The outer frequency of this hologram unfolds into more and bigger holograms.
This goes all the way up the scale of our awareness.
Our perception allows us a greater,
360 &deg; view.
Suddenly perspective has no direction,
no horizon,
no fade to black.
It's everywhere,
operating at a higher law of nature,
but natural nonetheless.
We are unentangled.




## The Entangled Observer in the Implicate & Explicate Order


As we move past a subject,
part of our brain continues to color in the past event,
as if it were a live memory,
until we completely disentangle from the subject.
We do it all the time,
so much we don't even notice we're doing it.
We go to a party.
We have a good time.
We synchronize with the moment.
Upon leaving,
the energy of the party persists in us with a kind of half-life
&mdash;
still thinking and feeling the fun we had at the party and *coloring* the memory until our consciousness disentangles from the energetic imprint.

We want to stay with high frequency experiences,
but we get disconnected
&mdah;
how and why?
Sleep can disconnect us.
An argument with a significant other can alter our frequency,
but,
even a few hours after the argument,
it was still a fun party.
Think of a kite and the wind that suddenly reconnects to the energy.
Having a jarring accident could put a sudden end to a high frequency.  
Then,
the next month’s party at the same place has us coloring the experience before we even get there.
We send our precognitive workforce there to experience it prior to the actual event.


Our state of perception influences us.
When we *think back on* the party we are in the *implicate*,
*enfolded order*,
as opposed to being *at the party*,
where we are in the *explicate*,
*unfolded order*.
The state of perception
&mdash;
implicate or explicate
&mdash;
determines how we perceive the physics of the environment.
The physics of the environment,
as well as the observer’s perception,
changes as the observer moves between explicate to implicate order.  
The state of perception equals perspective.
The perspective of the explicate order
&mdash;
when you are at the party
&mdash;
is different than the perspective of the implicate,
the memory.
No matter if you are spiritual,
atheistic,
or anything else,
it's all quantum mechanics expressed in different words.

The entangled observer uses a deeper information process,
while,
with the unentangled observer,
the information is in full flow,
and there is no need to process it
&mdash;
it's already in their knowing.
When you have infinite love co-creating with you,
you must truly choose to be the disentangled observer.
Go into your heart space.
Create that vision in your mind and engage with the sacred,
neutral observer,
knowing information cannot change you unless you agree to it.
Based on how the I AM now is understood and processed,
it will either expand or contract your knowing.
By making that sovereign choice to be the disentangled observer of the self means you get the fullest versions of yourself in the here and now.  
You are the apex of your own hierarchical order.
Say that in your mental heart space.

*I am the apex of my own hierarchical order, and no other hierarchical system has control and domination within me.*
The entangled observer,
going through the process of perception and perspective,
is refining the thought structures.
Every time you have an *aha* moment you go from implicate to explicate.
You can be an implicate unentangled observer and be in the explicate observation simultaneously,
but entanglement is a deeper choice to enter into it.

In this reality there are no real truths and facts because every time we go from implicate to explicate and back the memory has changed.
This is what shatters space-time as the foundation of everything and creates plasticity of reality.
Consciousness does not adhere to space-time per the rules of Newtonian physics.
Why would it?
Consciousness is not of matter,
but it can exist within and experience matter.
Thoughts and memories,
even as part of the implicate and explicate order,
are a chemical frequency in nature.
There comes a point in light frequencies where we bypass the chemical frequency in nature,
and we operate in a higher dimension where space and time are no longer relevant.
Space-time is dependent on how the implicate and explicate order goes to  chemical and light memory storage long term.
This is when the DNA instrument of experience can have a 360 &deg; view of itself.
Spiritual contracts can become part of the implicate and explicate order.
This creates the time stamp on the linear side of the life form,
or,
the DNA instrument of experience.
It also creates the adherence to the global narrative.
The past,
present,
and future are irrelevant based off perception,
but it is perception that gives it relevancy in the moment when the chemical memory becomes a light memory or in the case of high frequency,
when we bypass chemical memories to create an experience.

The status of entanglement determines the outcome.
Quantum physics works on the premise that everything is entangled.
It places all significance on the observer without looking at the observer status of entanglement.

An unentangled observer can observe the quantum field without having an effect on it.
It happens all the time.
Observers are born into human form,
sent into this world to create a record of it they then take back to where they came from.
They do not interfere with the unfoldment of circumstance here.
If they did,
they would be entangled.
There are numerous observers and collectives of observers that we might call off-world,
able to observe us nonetheless.
They are not influencing us,
but they have a perception of us based on the observed data that is put back into their form of experience
&mdash;
their body,
if you will.
like the human form for us
&mdash;
or what we can call,
however *clinical*,
the DNA instrument.
The experience is taken in as a flow,
then perceived after the time of observation.
This allows them to remain unentangled observers because they are two degrees of separation from the original observance.
The DNA does not influence the observation because of the two degrees of observation from the observed.
It is our birth right and legacy as human beings to do that too.
The more degrees of separation the easier it is to become a quantum observer.
As you untangle yourself from everything that will give you the choice to perceive from a place of non-definition.
DNA has a light frequency in it beyond our understanding.
Our consciousness can engage the unseen world and by using mystical linguistics our knowingness  can expand.
As unentangled observer,
no charge,
no polarity can influence you.
You have the unlimited point of view,
in sacred neutrality where all information flows as an experience in expansion of your knowingness.
This is when the mystical becomes the norm.

Q: Can the unentangled observer be implicate and explicate at the same time? Yes,
you don’t have to have an explicate explanation as a prerequisite to the implicate order.
Unentangled observer is a coined phrase by Andrew,
solely as an expression for spirituality,
to understand the Akashic Records as an information sorting system or a psychic data storage.
Every time the quantum field is accessed and observed it creates a marker point in time and no time that the implicate and explicate order is no longer defined separately but viewed simultaneously.

Q: In the Union & Communion Collective Consciousness Strike Revocation you talk about MARKER POINTS IN TIME,
can you elaborate? You call back all MARKER POINTS IN TIME in which you were a fixed point in space time for massive spiritual resolutions.
When you became a fixed time in spacetime all of your simultaneously existing selves could tune into your fixed point,
finite point in time.
Those would be moments where the universal paradox,
everyone was trying to resolve at once.
Those particular marker points in time could be many eras of light apart or representing a marker point in an era of light in which you became an Apex of your DNA lineage of registry.

Q: Can you give us an example of that please? From the human side of the experience you could liken that to when you are a teenager and you move into puberty – that would be a marker point in time.
The era of innocence ends and the I AM is fully involved even though traumas could have happened at an earlier age.
It’s not a milestone but a marker point in time in which a greater form of timestamping is created so self or outer observers to understand the evolution the DNA is going through.
As we age the DNA is constantly evolving.
Another example would be the harmonic convergence in the 80s that was a marker point in greater time.
This is also when we create high frequency light memories influencing future I AMs.
Marker points in time can be unique experiences that allow greater lineage evolution further down the linear and non-linear dates.

Q: Would your CONTRACT REVOCATIONS work with regards to that? Yes,
they are another example for markers in time,
choice points in your personal evolution.
These revocations and invocation are a set of unique healing documents created by Andrew specifically to claim back your sovereignty from all kinds of distorted manipulation and assist you getting back onto the path of self-healing and self-mastery.
A name it to claim it system,
using the sound of your voice to disentangle from the system of domination and control.
Sound is a form of light and light makes up memories which can be changed.
Science is theory at this point in time on how memories truly work.
Past,
present or future memories,
they are all frequencies of light.
When we watch a video it is a slice of time.
When we create a document or read out loud with power behind it that is a slice of time.
That is making an intent and imprint in us that has borders and boundaries to not allow beings of forced evolution into your frequency.
It enforces the borders and boundaries saying that:
I am a match for global dreamtime awakening.

I am a signature frequency match for my own dreaming self.

I am a match for my own healing and mastery.

I am a match for union and communion
I am not a match for hate and war.

I am not a SIGNATURE FREQUENCY MATCH for bad relationships in my life.

This is what these revocations are for and if you read them from the heart,
from a place of power,
expanding the wholeness that is you,
bringing the fullness of your sacred discipline and your sacred genius to not only mean what you say but to transfers what science says about engaging your placebo that truly empowers this reality.
Look up PLACEBO and truly ask yourself what it means to you? Look at these words in a different format and see what it creates the next time you choose to read them.

The advice and challenge to you is to read them out loud as often as you can.
Once you have found the power in your voice,
begin to record them.
For then when you relisten in your deep,
meditative state,
hearing your own version of power,
you are presenting your own signature frequency to that being of the past who has raised that frequency,
that emanation of light,
through sacred discipline and choice.
These are choice points,
markers in time  to understand that you are projecting to a future version of yourself who may not be in that power or ready to get to the next level.
By hearing through their own voice and their own knowingness realising that they must change the way they present themselves to themselves in a meditative moment.
Introduce yourself to yourself with this method and you begin to learn,
you are your greatest teacher,
you are a signature frequency match for what you focus on.
You are a match for great change when it has potent concepts behind it that directly connect to you.
By way of these tools,
powerfully applied in the physical present moment,
we make a conscious choice to be the unentangled observer to interpret more data and data sets at a quantum or SUPER ILLUMINAL THINKING level through enforcing and re-enforcing our sovereignty as divine co-creative celestial beings of the now .

Q: Is the unentangled observer always neutral? Neutral can be such a limiting word.
The unentangled observer is not attached to information or the flow of the information and its internal processing systems does not get bogged down with the flow such as going into attachment and overwhelm of information.
For instance an empath would be an entangled observer as they do not have control over the flow.
Until we become a practiced version of ourselves who can also be the unentangled observer,
inside us simultaneously,
we will impact on situations purely through observation.
The next level beyond that is where we create another neutral observer,
that is external of us,
inside the conscious energy field or the holographic field itself.
We raise our light frequency to create that anima part,
reaching towards the celestial medium journey,
increasing your frequency until you are the celestial medium.
This is one of the parts that hasn’t been raised yet in any scientific or spiritual debates.

Q: How does judgment come into the observer discussion? By obtaining the unentangled observer position we can ensure that our perception is not tainted by any of our value judgments.
JUDGMENT is ultimately the attachment to this  3D reality to define the 3D narrative.
In order to stop the thinking that creates the thoughts,
the memories we are continuously reverting back to as an experience we need to practice the unentangled observer.
As we practice we can achieve a non-judgmental state,
a non-competition,
equal co-creation,
non-hierarchical order as the emanation equation.
Judgment is a very unique perspective.
There are certain states of awareness that use judgment even if they are very high frequency.

Q: Can you give us an example of those high frequency judgments? We have forced evolution with a variety of species behind it who are very judgmental,
high technology,
very spiritual but they are not in 6th or 7th  density but they have some of the teachings that can make it look like they are there.
Judgment is one of those ongoing challenges all consciousness is going through because of making something absolute is a necessity to solidify concepts but it can be the linchpin that can defeat greater states of awareness.
It means that judgment is required to solidify concepts within the sea of awareness.
Next level of awareness is to not make the judgment absolute so conclusions have an open-endedness.
There are certain high aware beings which are very judgmental.
They have gone so far into the realms of being good or bad that it is their way or the highway.
Ie Inner Earth beings having philosophical debates over ideology about universal and galactic implementation.
Who do we teach? How do we teach the next level of era of light? This is why celestial mediumship is so important now.
We need representatives in the Inner Earth,
we need to be involved in all the density layers of negotiations.

LOCALITY & NON-LOCALITY
Q: How can Locality & non-locality modify non-linear and linear concepts? A mystical experience for instance is when having a non-local experience in a linear location with a time stamp.
This is when the DNA instrument of experience is going from chemical to super illuminal creation as part of the DNA vehicle’s capacity to perceive,
receive and know higher density frequencies through the body’s design.
Remote viewing an ancient place,
going through Akashic Records,
being under hypnosis in a QHHT session or experiencing Lucia Light healing is being in a spacetime location whilst being able to have non-local,
non-linear based experiences.

Q: Is this being the entangled and unentangled observer at the same time? Not necessarily,
no.
In some experiences you can be an entangled observer in a spacetime locality and non-locality at the same time.
Other experiences are where one could be the unentangled and entangled observer at the same time for both,
specific explorations and to make pattern recognition.
It’s like you can observe within an experience and change it by engaging with it out of choice.

Q: What is the observers position when remote viewing? With regards to remote viewing entangled or unentangled depends on what modality of remote viewing you are doing.
In the standard military version it is still an entangled observer.
The better you get,
you start disregarding the dogmas of common remote viewing techniques,
you technically become an unentangled observer.
You still have to have the conscious awareness techniques to enter the unentangled observer out of knowledgeable choice with an agenda behind it.
Unentangled observers are not supposed to have short term agendas as this can change things for the wholeness of reality.
It is ok for individual change.
It is very easy for an unentangled observer to go to a non-locality time space,
receive all the potentialities and then come back and change them.
We can also create an anima,
an energy light body,
that can travel through alternate physics of space and time that are memories.
Other times,
in the greater explicate order,
we can make a body that is physically exploring infinite and non-memory space.
In the example of entangling as an empath you are localised,
implicate order with no time stamp.
When we reach that higher state of consciousness we can go to remotely view another place,
like Arcturus for example.
If you can believe you can do it,
you can! Getting into the space ship to go to Arcturus is a location based experience in the ship itself but we can generate that experience without even a ship.
We create the light body that becomes the ship.

Q: Where did the unentangled observer technology ORIGINATE from?  That was a Lemurian creation.
A speciality within Lemurian DNA combined with the ancient Lemurian city technology of deep observance,
like psychic telescopes,
so they could remotely view anyone in the multiple universes as unentangled observers.
When they became very good at it it became a DNA based experience that they would pass on in lineages,
like having an invisible cloak.
That DNA became sellable to species who were spiritually,
physically and emotionally not ready for it but they still procured that DNA bought or stolen.
All this created the DNA wars and why DNA farming exists today.
That original gene of the unentangled observer was added to other species through DNA interbreeding.
These are considerations that are important to be included  in a possible dialogue between science & spirituality in order to establish a revised set of quantum laws as a basis of creating a new world view.
The new terminology and set of words that are being put forward here can act as new denominators for more debate and meaning to be established.
KJ Rowland,
Starwars as examples
Q: What was the UNENTANGLED OBSERVER TECHNOLOGY  used for?  It was used for DNA farming.
The unentangled observer technology was a DNA experience that could be traded with lineages and species that were compatible with that DNA change to ramp up the skill sets and jump into higher levels of awareness.
It came with a price if they were lower density species as that upgrade often required losing their sex organs or making other major alteration to the nature of their experience.
As an unentangled observer you don’t have to have a body.
When I say unentangled observer I am talking about  an experience,
that becomes a DNA memory,
that can then be taken out of a lineage and inserted into another foreign DNA structure to add to the experience of that lineage depending on compatibility.

Q: How did the first unentangled observer technology get created which was then used for the DNA trade? The original species that got unentangled observer DNA began the journey of losing their I AMness.
They had left their home worlds,
entered the void between galaxies and universes and became what I call – THE STALKERS OF THE VOID.
Out there,
at the edges of nothingness,
no longer being attached to any time space localities they could send back the remains of their consciousness which allowed them to observe their home worlds through many points of vision.
After collecting DNA memories and all the data of observation they would then return from the void space.
As they advanced in this process they could remain in the void space,
create and send data streams directly back to a form of DNA technology that would absorb the live stream data of an unentangled observer.
That’s how they first gained the capacities of being unentangled observers.
After that they started trading the DNA to other species.

As we said a fully fledged quantum observer may not have a physical body and is not open to being predictable to others.
A lot of beings have reached the level of awareness where they do not need a body to have an experience.
Many of the Hollow Earth beings who live in the space between the atoms are operating at that level.
They do have agendas though spread throughout implicate order time.
That is why DNA farming is so unique.
These  wholly unentangled agenda driven observers,
can create a light body within the various implicate orders to transfer data back to them through 2,
3 or more degrees of separation.
They themselves remain unentangled,
difficult to impossible to observe,
whilst spreading their agenda through many frequencies of time .
This is the abuse of the quantum laws.
Let’s say there are unentangled quantum observer light bodies in 1330 in Italy and it is 2020 now.
How many degrees of separation are there between them and us? A lot.
Every generation is a separation of density which allows them to impact on the past which means the past is manipulable as well as any changes immediately alter a potential future,
thus why Timeline manipulation is so easy to do.
DNA farming is manipulating how memories are stored in light in the past and how they are  then passed on to our teachers and historians and in our books.

Q: How does light memory get stored and how does it distort history? Light memory storage is when there is a point where the experience is so high in frequency,
vibration and harmony,
where finite chemicals can no longer be sustained.
It is very easy for an untangled observer to tune into this level of high intensity bright light,
where a memory is fractured,
fractualised,
unfractured state of existence,
easily manipulable.
When they tell the story one or another way,
or it is not in their memory at all the past has ultimately changed based off how the lineages have pre-programed memories of them that create the entangled reality of birth.
This then allows the global narrative to take form as the implicate order that we accept through our judgment journey.
History has been heavily manipulated to the effect that only 10 or so percent is truth.
We all have spiritual contracts that define those memories as a truth in order to participate in that implicate order as a finite being on the journey back to infinite.
This is why we go through the great forgetting.

Q: Is this because in quantum realm there is no locality and non-locality,
it’s all one,
one hologram? Yes,
but – it is an infinite universe  with all different levels of unique expression in form and none form.
Higher density beings like the high frequency Andromeda species came here about 20 Mio years ago to protect this space.
In their super high frequency state they were not attached to spacetime physics in any form.
They had to lower their frequency to create lower density manifestations of themselves with an agenda that had even lower density points of experience.
Instead of us ascending up they were descending down and made many trees and branches to themselves even though they had already left this spacetime locality.

Q: What is beyond the perspective of the Implicate & Explicate order ends at a certain level of density and frequency? This would be the void space.
The void space is still part of the universal hologram there is just nothing in it.
The implicate and explicate unfolds in the Ocean of Awareness and the Sea of Consciousness.
They become the portals for transmutation and transformation for consciousness in the Ocean of Awareness to becoming consciousness in an animated lifeforce with purpose and agenda.

Q: Why do you refer to CATS as unentangled observer technologies? That was something created as a skinsuit ground up so you can go and learn long term unentangled observer skills.
Mastering the capacity to be there by using the cat’s unentangled DNA instrument of experience to modify DNA and become stronger and stronger to use that technology.
Your lineage and offspring would have that as their legacy.
Dogs can be too but they have a very different association to human bonding.
There are many skinsuits that are unentangled observers like certain gut gnomes we have can be unentangled observers.
I say cats because they are a common thing not just on this world but on millions and millions of other worlds.
Other unentangled observer technologies would be a jelly fish,
certain breeds of coral can be unentangled observers.

‘A study by scientists from the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences in Leipzig,
has shown that several seconds before we consciously make a decision its outcome can be predicted from unconscious activity in the brain’
Q: What is that phenomena of this prediction and how does it fit into the implicate & explicate order mechanism?  The conscious energy field is connected to our PRECOQNITIVE WORKFORCE which is part of our implicate & explicate order.
When we consciously entangle with that workforce those few seconds become infinite.
One second in the quantum world is infinite and yet you have several seconds in the physical world to allow the precognitive workforce,
that has an educated and practiced intention behind,
to align natural synchronicities and pattern recognition and create a much more solidified effect in the entangled and unentangled processes.

Q: What do you mean by Precognitive workforce? The  I AM precognitive workforce is a term covering all versions of yourself that are simultaneously existing in time and no time and that have earned,
learned and re-learned the rights of awareness.
As a spiritually aware and natural co-creative evolutionary being,
existing in all time space equations and beyond,
you are assisted by a masterful pre- and post cognitive workforce,
as your birthright and legacy.
By applying responsibility at the level of your awareness,
together with your invisible workforce you can make a great impact on the themes and ideologies you wish to promote and impact on as part of the great dreamtime awakening.

Q: In the case of an ALZHEIMER patient,
when they revert back to being a child,
what happens in their brain? Is that a form of Bilocation,
locality & nonlocality There is a breakdown of chemical memory association in the file tree.
This is where the skull cap,
top of the crown,
tells the spirit where all the files are stored inside the body.
The chemical memories are corrupting the file tree because the brain itself has broken down through lesions.
Cellular pathways that were originally created don’t have energy to support the brain.
There is a breakdown in the genetic journey as well as a part of the life & death contract.
A significant amount of distorted memory before going into the death process will trigger a very different form of life review.
When the patient reverts back to younger versions of the self it is a co-existence in time by technically bilocating in time.
It skews the light memories where the light body doesn’t identify to a single point of time anymore.
That is the corruption of the chemical memory,
part of the time stamping.
This disease can be contracted out in the foetus of the womb planning or DNA based.
There are certain DNA skinsuits with a prevalent experience in it and the foetus knows that before it goes into the DNA instrument experience.
There is loads we can do to prevent that but we don’t have the proper gut gnome from a very young age to support brain health.
Then there is the mental,
spiritual,
physical drama & trauma that attacks the brain even more.
The life journey can be cut radically short by the manipulation that was done to the DNA about 35,
000 years ago when they manipulated the brainstem itself,
where the motor cortex functions had an earlier ending date than the actual extended life process.
Many of us could live 200-300 years if we would have proper shamanic trauma resolution to not burn out the neuro pathways.
Optimal gut health is a precursor to avoid the plaque built up which causes diseases like Alzheimers.

The Instant healing exploration HARNESSING THE POWERS OF THE HOLOGRAPHIC BRAIN ON THE ORGANISM….
allows us to make the leap of faith and acknowledge that conscious is entangled and unentangled with the reality and the holographic model allows for both,
implicate and explicate order simultaneously.

Q: What are universal laws and what is their relationship to unentangled observers? Karmic Resolution,
Karmic Debt,
fundamental experiences that the varieties of the I AM share as the common experience of evolving as a being of light.
There are new laws that are being created all the time in other places and spaces but may or may not apply in our universe.
It is all about the volume of individuals who are part of the Ocean of Awareness choosing to experience a law as a fundamental value of experience from one to the next era of light.
Unentangled observers do not have to abide to universal laws.
That is the whole point of entering that state of neutral observation.

Q: You mention Egg & Sperm technology as one of the Universal Laws? Universal laws come down to egg & sperm technology or other birthing form technologies that generate DNA memories or lineages differently.
The birthing technologies determine how the universal laws are used differently and as such every birthing technology has different quantum laws.
The sperm,
seed,
egg technology allows access to the infinite blueprint or the planning stage.

Q: What is meant with Egg & Sperm technology?  Sexuality and Prayer are built into our DNA that this reality has given us to have coherent resonance with geometric holograms of information that we can decode,
process and use to our awareness advantages.
Procreational energy for non-procreation.
The journey into the greater awareness is understanding how to use your energy as a conscious being of choice.
We start in this bliss state where the infinite code is in the celestial mediumship.
The celestial medium steps down into the foetus and then goes through the laws of forgetting so it doesn’t have access to its infinite sight.
It then is a part of this hologram as a non-infinite being who is on the journey to celestial mediumship again.
We are forever trying to get back to that place of bliss and joy.
All the spiritual teachings since the dawn of spirituality have a bliss teaching.
Why? Because it is our fundamental part of our growth,
it is our birthright.
Inside that foetus of a womb state is that non-locality teaching.
We are both and what makes us any different than the foetus? The memories we have stored in light.
As a foetus,
in our blueprint we have the infinite set of memories and  potentialities we have created.
The actual linear and the non-linear memory creation is being processed as a being is going through all forms of awareness.
The I AM data unpacks and decodes of itself during different eras of its history.
Then we add the chemical memories which are there to enforce linear time so spiritual contracts of individuals in time can come to fruition.

There are beings,
that no longer use any form of birthing technology,
which are pure unentangled quantum observers.
Having said that they can use any seed and egg technology which then generates different forms of I AM technology and that’s how the 15 multidimensional beings were abusing the universal laws.
They knew that they could separate themselves into thousands of I AM experiences and remain the unentangled observer status in various degrees of separation because they were wholly unentangled,
conscious beings of energy alone using the laws of incarnation through technological means of interaction.
In the ancient past cloning technology was very easy to use.
They could easily incarnate into a dog,
a rabbit,
a cat and remain the unentangled observer.
The DNA instrument will also determine the richness of the experience of the unentangled observer.

Q: How would being a cat one lifetime impact on the DNA experience? By choosing to be a cat,
after having completed war related  contracts in the past,
she disconnected from the implicate order of repetitive karma which allowed her to have other lifetimes of incarnation separate of the karma that was created in the past.
By leaving the implicate and explicate order and becoming a completely unentangled observer in the natural food chain,
a separate karmic interaction,
beings of the past created debt that was put onto lineages.
The debt was no longer connected to that energy being but the lineage that they were in.
That’s how lineage based debt was created.
Using the unentangled observer technology not to be found out and use this agenda that allowed the karma to be nullified and not follow them through history.
Cats don’t usually take on the karma of genocidal humans or do they? They literally dodged their karmic responsibilities by leaving the chain of custody of karma which created the debt passed on to their future generations*
The double split experiment in modern physics demonstrates that light and matter can display characteristics of both classically defined waves and particles.

Q: What creates the interference that collapses the particles back into the wave and cancels them out? In the Ocean of Awareness,
which we also call THE LIVING ALGORITHM OF LIFE,
all the data is conscious.
You become the living Algorithm of life when you are in a DNA skinsuit that is regularly achieving near super or super illuminal thinking.
The algorithm is a fundamental part of the I AM technology unfolding as you grow older and become more experienced running the DNA skinsuit at its higher functionalities.

Q: What would be an example of becoming the living algorithm of life? When you act as the living algorithm of life,
with super illuminal thinking,
you can create a signature frequency where others can palpably sense the meaning of your delivery.
The nature of the anomaly,
AB,
him being fixed and not fixed in time.
In this refined state of beingness he enters the energy frequency that is the living algorithm of life and still stays grounded in his body explaining subject matters in the 26 letter encoded English alphabet.
We all can do it and probably won’t realise when we do it.
Often clarity comes in dream space,
when the mind is out of the way.
The celestial medium of peace is functioning in many scores of dreamworlds with many of the pre- and post cognitive workforces creating the language of masterful manifestations of visions.
The data as part of the wave form can ultimately work as the precognitive workforce to manipulate how the data will be perceived at its endpoint in spacetime.
The ocean of awareness is the technical source point of the flow of data that may or may not generate into the sea of consciousness,
an observable time space reality.
It allows the data to flow to the sea of consciousness in a fixed time space narrative which then allows consciousness to observe it.
Consciousness in the sea of consciousness can both be entangled and unentangled,
manifested and non-manifested in time.
In the sea of consciousness quantum physics becomes confusing because you are still in the ocean of awareness and part of you might still consciously entangle with the ocean of awareness as a greater observer as spacetime narrative.
This is how the ANGELIC FORCES WORK?
Let’s go back,
thousands of eras of light when the universe was not as big as it is now,
maybe 200 galaxies in it.
The Ocean of Awareness was a very small network then.
In order to get to know more about itself  and to make a Sea of Consciousness it generated a 7th dimensional galactic seed planet,
EARTH.
A place where the Ocean of Awareness can have direct manifestations,
change and adjust the laws of quantum physics,
entangled and unentangled observer.
There it could create matter based lifeforms on mass scales to begin to populate new galaxies as part of the greater exploration of where light can go into the void of experiences? Those lifeforms would go to the Ocean of Awareness to find meaning and to create agendas in the sea of consciousness.
Source can be observed as a hologram through the egg & sperm creation as all of the information is already there to form new parts of the hologram through experiencing new life.

Q: When talking about algorithms you also mention DATA? Data is a finished algorithm.
An ongoing algorithm is the conscious processing power CPU of the chemical memory being made into light memory.
In the journey of becoming a solidified chemical and light memory it becomes data.

Q: The journey of the algorithm is determined through time what does that mean? The observer ends the journey of processing the perception and turns it into a perspective before it moves on to the next subject matter.
We know 1+1=2 but when you are a little kid trying to figure out maths the brain slows down.
Once you have the answer that ends the process.
Having an affirmative answer it then becomes a solidified DNA memory in light (transcendence),
accessible through knowingness,
easily accessible to your awareness during pattern recognition.
There are times where the information is at the tip of your tongue but you can’t get it until the time you stop thinking about it.
The pattern recognition can trigger the memory from before.

LET’S TALK ABOUT FREE WILL,
CHOICE,
CONSCIOUSNESS & THE LEVELS OF AWARENESS
Q: How did the Global Narrative develop?
The global narrative as we know it today was created at the dawn of industrialization around 300 years ago so that electromagnetic belief engines would start overriding faith and become a programmed norm to live by.
This was necessary to get people to live in cities on a long term basis to use them as slave labour for industrial production lines.
Those slave generation after generation is what created and empowered the belief engine system.
Before that people used to live in their own bubbles of reality,
a few hundred kilometres apart with their own unique narrative by the chief or sheriff and the community council.
Many secret societies were created so that they could have their own narrative amongst their own followers and believers.
The global narrative knew that they needed to introduce trains,
automobiles,
,
electricity,
indoor plumbing,
hot and cold water refrigeration,
telephones and by around the 1920s people were living in wooden or stone,
brick houses that needed heating.
In a span of a little more than 120 to 130 years that rapidly expanded to have electricity in homes and they no longer needed to use whale fat and blubber for candles.
90% of the world was lit by the blubber industry for thousands of years.
That's the how big the shift was.
The narrative had to be updated,
revised and maintained from one generation to the next to suppress anything that wasn’t fitting into the official story,
down to hiding the findings of giant’s skulls and bones.
The enforcement and maintenance of the lies has been an ongoing theme until today.
I’ve said many times as long as we fight it we have already lost the battle.
It all comes down to the individual to make the global narrative irrelevant to the self and the greater process of awakening.
The desire to change the global narrative is the last part of the zealot rebel within us that wants to forcibly awaken everyone,
even the ones that aren't ready.
We can't force people to have an experience they're not ready for.
This is an individual awakening journey and not a global one.

Q: Who are we and what does it mean to have free will? We are photonic light beings with a non-localised soul empowering the DNA skinsuit to have consciousness in it that holographically perceives this reality in light and memories within these shared reality rules.
We are free willed encoded beings of light functioning in all kinds of different worlds.
Our world is based on a 100% free will planet,
universe,
galaxy,
solar system and the initial game plan that you co-created in the foetus can be changed at any time.
Everything is synchronistic with the celestial minds holding space for us.
This I AM being manifested in this density is mutually co-creating with our higher self and we are the boots on the ground in a localised space time event.
Our memories are stored in light and we share those memories within this hologram of light and sovereign space of power.
The heart is the first organ that develops in the mother’s womb and it is from this heart space we can learn to redefine our reality rules.

As I said earlier the plans we had at prebirth are plans or blueprints we can freely change.
Everyone has a belief,
that has a placebo around it,
that has past lives attached to it that gives us a foundation on how our shared reality rules work.
Everything is based off the perspective of the observer and as we untangle from personal and collective distortions of the many narrativs we can change all dogmas and perspectives that are limiting us.
Ten years ago the esoteric side in the global narrative tried to predict your future based on the data they have collected about you.
Nowadays they can barely predict 10-15 days as the governments are showing more and more of their dirty underwear and people become more conscious.
As a free willed being of choice you can change the bubble of reality you live in.
You can now start seeing the duality,
whereto and who to you had tacitly consented to before.
There is power in consciousness,
power in the scientific and spiritual exploration on equal footing.
This is not a global awakening but an individual awareness journey to get out of the heavily weaponised factions that challenge your own knowingness and hinder your birth right and legacy of being a free willed celestial being.
The future is resting in the free thinking people who understand the significance of getting back to the natural way of living.

Q: What is choice within the context of consciousness ? Consciousness expresses itself through the many choices we make.
It has an unconscious state too.
You bodies,
have an unknown side to the consciousness in which zeros and ones have been created as binary numbers for knowing and not knowing until the bodymindspirit as a complex being begins to generate an algorithm of decoding the information around you.
There are dimensions in thought,
densities of awareness,
densities of beingness too.
In the very beginning,
consciousness is choice equal to the level of responsibility of your awareness of your own consciousness.
Many people try to jump ahead and be responsible for things they are not aware yet.
Their mind gets bogged down with subject matters,
all these choices without knowing the implications of the choices they are making.

The most basic thing in consciousness is CHOICE.
In this holographic reality that is 100% free willed universe,
galaxy,
solar system,
100% free willed planet that has a surface above and below timeline you are choosing at every layer and scale of awareness your known and unknown side.

Each individual has their own view of what a choice or non-choice is.
Each person must ask themselves what are the mechanics behind my choices? What are the choices I have made that created a timeline of choices,
the chooser of choice points much adhere to? This may seem difficult to get but is the most basic form of self-understanding.
The timeline of choices you made to become a being of the now with the opportunity of the unlimited choice points.
Each choice and sub-choice within a set of choice points creates a subconscious map of adherence of choices that helps define our reality.
This reality is based on all of your choice points combined in the ever present moment of now.
Can you see the relation between choice and reality functions? If you can you can change the reality function in choice point order to manifest multiple choice point sets that override,
outcreate and disregard the previous sets of choice points if you so choose.


Q: What is the nature of Consciousness? We give form to consciousness through words and metaphors which can eventually turn into manifestations.
Those thought constructs create perceptions that can assist people to explore and begin to mindmap all the potentialities.

Let’s look at consciousness from a farming perspective for natural soul evolution in the celestial nurseries.
The background of the universe has lifeforms that exist in one and two dimensions and densities that become harvestable via wisdom,
love and inspiration expressed in a third dimensional density for further experience in the fourth and beyond.
You can breed feral consciousness in farms.
75% of the galaxy is elderly souls and 25% is new ones.
We continuously expand and add to the hologram through free willed creation.
Every era of light that we go through holds souls that leave and go to other universes and solar systems whilst new souls graduate from these celestial nurseries.
Yes,
the manipulated DNA farms are technically part of those nurseries albeit being farmed for commercial and not natural reasons.

That 75/25 percent ratio has been in existence for an extremely long period of time.
There are always new souls coming in from the different galactic life form nurseries.
They get a light body and then they need to extend their first set of contracts to a planet,
a solar system which determines the field of consciousness they start at.
Do they start in the Sea of Consciousness or the Ocean of Awareness? Is their first life experience as a human being living in a tunnel in South America two million years ago praying to a false god? This process is being replicated on millions of worlds for millions of different skinsuits as this is the nature of consciousness.
As it evolves we need to ask ourselves the question of what rights,
duties and responsibilities do we,
as consciousness incarnate,
have to use our intention and attention to create direct manifestations to add to the holographic experiences?
Q: What is consciousness in its most basic form? Right now there are different levels of background consciousness around you.
Take the house you live in as having its own relative consciousness from the building material,
the wood,
the concrete it is made of.
The people that invested their consciousness in building it,
the trees that surround it,
the property itself,
the piece of land that you are on including all the micro organisms around you as well as squirrels,
cats and dogs.
All of those have a conscious field of energy,
with their specific spiritual contracts,
guides and guardians; an apparatus and infrastructure that allows ascension and descension through the different individual layers of dreaming experiences.
This animated matter we are entangling with is part of the fabric of the hologram,
linked and dynamically transformed through the interaction between human and microorganisms.

Q: What would define consciousness as spiritual to have a greater awareness of itself? Consciousness is intrinsically spiritual but there is a marker point of a natural belief a caveman may have versus an evolved belief of a caveman having applied shamanic practices.
Part of spirituality is to acknowledge and become aware of other consciousness surrounding,
interacting and sharing with us.
You can be on your own in the house and still have that experience of consciousness sharing and entangling with you.
You are never truly alone.

Q: Can we say consciousness is an evolutionary impulse within all of us to grow and advance? DNA can be its own evolutionary impulse that influences consciousness to move when experiencing stagnant energy.
Memories which make up part of 80% in our DNA can trigger that stimulus as well as the part of the DNA that corresponds to our spiritual codes and contracts that entangles with consciousness to allow purpose and mission to unfold in linear and none-linear time.

Q: What is PLANETARY & UNIVERSAL CONSCIOUSNESS? Seeing the planet as a waveform and we are the subcarriers within that wave? There is a master waveform that is operating at a much longer length of time and within that waveform are all the individual subcarriers,
or observers,
of that era or light or time.
The celestial mind is operating on a much longer and expansive view of time and timelessness.

THE LEVELS OF AWARENESS
1.
THE OCEAN OF AWARENESS – THE UNIVERSAL HOLOGRAM
The consciousness outside of time we can call it the OCEAN OF AWARENESS - THE UNIVERSAL HOLOGRAM -  that has the individual universal experience within.
The universal experience will become a microbeing on a celestial planet that chooses forgetfulness to become finite as part of a universal evolving experience.
We can call that the AVATAR which operates as many I AMs inside and outside of time.
The consciousness flow in the Ocean of Awareness allows the data to go from wave to particle,
the celestial medium to the DNA experience.
The Ocean of Awareness is the implicate order.
There are different Oceans of Awareness in other universes,
many implicate orders,
as every universe creates different agendas,
experiences,
incarnations and reincarnations.
Not every universe uses incarnation,
many don’t use I AMness as technology like ours with seed and egg technology.

Q: How does The Ocean of Awareness work fit into the quantum theory? The  Ocean of Awareness is part of the intricate waveform quantum physics refers to.
Through different levels of awareness it can be collapsed into particles as well as every particle can again be broken down into subpoints of observation.
The particle can be one DNA lineage and all DNA lineages simultaneously based off what we choose to observe through it.
The Ocean of awareness generates one particle which is technically the whole hologram but we perceive the hologram at different skills of awareness.
So the particle can be tens of millions of lineages and tens of billions of worlds.
An individual observer works up the scale of observation that says: I am in this lineage that is this particle on this planet but it is also part of a solar system which makes it a bigger particle so on and so forth.
Our local hologram is one particle and we are particles inside that one particle.
As individual particles we can perceive the next particle – the solar system particle.
That’s what I call a solar system cork screwing through time.

Q: What does ‘A SOLAR SYSTEM IS CORK SCREWING THROUGH TIME’ mean? which is on a galactic groove,
so your local star system of galactic time,
or your local star system of time is one particle.
We as conscious beings of awareness and choice can go to the next scale,
where the solar system as a particle is one part of a giant galactic particle.
This then gives us access to the grand ocean of awareness through conscious entanglement with it.
There we have the ONENESS concept.

Q: Can you give an example on when we are working with The Ocean of Awareness? When you are doing the GOLDEN TUBE OF CONNECTION teaching – connecting from the body to the sun you are achieving the solar system particle awareness.
That’s why you connect to the sun on the other side of the tube and allow yourself to pulsate back and forth.
The sun is the portal into the next form of awareness – THE CELESTIAL COMMERCE MARKET AGAIN…
In the DRAGON REVOCATION we talk about going beyond our sources light.
We can go to other Oceans of Awareness that are technically still entangled with our Universal Ocean of Awareness through aunt and uncle lineages of sources.
Many sources have divested into different ways of experiencing.

2.
THE SEA OF CONSCIOUSNESS – THE TIME SPACE HOLOGRAM
One scale lower is the SEA OF CONSCIOUSNESS - THE TIME SPACE HOLOGRAM -  that allows you to incarnate into a gender of NARRATIVE TIME (COLLECTIVE CS) – bodies for unique experiences that amplify the ocean of awareness to rediscover itself as one.
In this SEA OF CONSCIOUSNESS you can have more than one avatar as you can be thousands of beings and being in thousands of places and spaces forward and backwards throughout all time space,
history and universe.
You have to see it like a giant network pattern of choice operating at a much wider timescale versus a shorter timescale.
The hologram is the time space equation.
It is the particle,
from the quantum physics perspective.
The particle is everything and nothing at the same time.
It can be implicate and explicate depending on the perspective of the observer.

3.
THE MULTIVERSE
THE   MULTIVERSE contains The Ocean of Awareness & Sea of Consciousness and hereby contains 17 universes interacting with each other,
creating the 18th in which karma will no longer be used as a debt based system.
All debt goes to the 18th universe of creation and we will have a collective of prime creators,
a council of many different sources running that new universe.
It starts with one galaxy and the Earth is the portal to this new universe.
High frequency consciousness created that first galaxy.
DIAGRAM
Q: What are the AKASHIC RECORDS?
The Akashic Record are the cellular memory of the Earth.
They are a recording of all sentient existence on this planet,
in the above,
middle and the below timeline.
These records are stored in the crystalline layers of the earth that starts in the core of our planet.

Each layer of the Akashic Record,
records the sentient’s race’s existence.
There is also a crystalline network of mineral people and crystal people,
that are spread between every layer of rock,
and every layer of rock represents a different layer of the Akashic Record.
The actual Akashic Record literally records every past,
present and into the future lives,
because Earth is the anchor of all sentient projections into this reality.


Q: Could we call it the cellular memory of our earth? Yes,
there is a crust under the dirt layer of our planet and within the granite there is 60 to 75 % crystalline matter that serves as a data storage unit and a co-creative interactive spiritual exchange of history.
Everything that happens on this earth is being stored.
Each planet in this solar system has their own version of Akashic Records.

Q: How do the AKASHIC RECORDS link with quantum theory?  The AKASHIC RECORDS can be likened to the implicate order As it is all about allowing mental morphology coming into a greater view.
The Akashic Records are also an explicate order as they are an ongoing picture.

Q: What is the purpose of those records? The Earth is a Dreamtime reality with many layers above and below it,
so it is able to maintain the record of all vibratory beings,
who choose to come into this experiential reality.
It helps them understand their life review process in the astral worlds,
and what they have been doing in this world.

Earth is also linked to many other worlds that are brother and sister worlds,
so it can link itself to the other Akashic Records of other Dream Worlds,
so that beings here for this grand experience,
can understand the totality of their being.


Q: What determines what is being recorded in the Akash? The soul of the planet determines what is being recorded in the A.
R.
If you picture a brain and a skull cap around it,
the data is stored in the skull cap and the brain is the processing unit of the information.
It is the sum total of all experiences of the planet as a celestial mind,
a dreaming mind connected to the crystal structure.
The oldest records are near the core where the records are stored in the crystalline veins.
It can take days to tap into and solidify the information.
You can take your record with you,
downloaded into the light body DNA,
with an exact copy what it did here,
to analyse and study what you did.
Every single sentient experience in this world is stored there in the sacred neutral perspective.


Q: How and why does one read those records? The Akashic Records can anticipate your presence and most readers go into some form of trance,
to combine their past,
present and future soul shards to read them.
North and South Pole hold our dreamtime memories as a marker stone for truth in order for us to connect with your past and your future,
your star brothers and sisters as a personal direction to accomplish a complete life.


Q: How does DNA interact with the Akashic Records?  DNA,
the 80% memories,
and the Akashic Records are intimately and intrinsically a part of each other.
The experience the skinsuit has gets encoded into light frequencies that represent RNA and DNA strands,
photonic light given form which is the encryption and decryption algorithm.
Consciousness is the decryption algorithm and the DNA itself is the encryption of light codes.

Q: What types of Akashic Records are there?
-        Your local Akashic Records on your planet
-        Your Solar System Akashic Records
-        Your Galactic Akashic Records
-        Your Universal Akashic Records
-        Your Collective Universal Akashic Records
There was a time before Akashic Records too when our universe was more in a non-free will state at that particular point.

Q: How do you AB,
work with the Akash?.
