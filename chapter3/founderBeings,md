## Founder Beings

We were not a farm in the beginning.
When the founder beings created us,
we were the infrastructure that kept their cities,
countries,
nations,
and space stations repaired,
self-updating,
and clean.
They kept us as butlers and servants.
we were iPhones,
their technology,
not living beings,
at least from their perspective.
We were programmable DNA.
Millions of us went on extended journeys with the founders.
We went all around the universe.
We had experiences that elevated our life force.
The founders could harvest a whole solar system in a very positive way.
They went into the solar systems and planted crystal mounts and moved stones around.
Every few hundred years they returned and modified the surface circuitry to be beneficial to life force.
The ancients moved water between planets.
The water was imprinted and programmed.
The water stored data and taught lessons.

Water moved from one planet to another is called *legacy water*.
It helps seed the raw food chain of life in the microorganisms.
This makes oceans work.
It's like starter water in a fish tank.
It has the right amount of microorganisms in it.
It's filtered and fish can eat and grow.
The founder beings transferred water and ice.
This built up massive amounts of microorganisms that supported the food chain.
The evolutionary process results in a species multiplication.
They were architects who designed solar systems by seeding planets.


At a point in the process the ancients left.
They often didn't come back for millions of years.
The existing technology awakened
&mdash;
sentience.
This started the gene farming.
The planets needed input from the ancients,
the founding races,
to positively evolve.
The remaining artificial intelligence disagreed on how to evolve.
There were many aggressive races.
They gained various levels of awareness,
took over territories,
and defended against invading races like the Annunaki,
who came into an area and saw entirely created solar systems
&mdash;
all the technology on the surface with nothing defending it.


The surface beings were obedient to the interlopers.
The journey of a soul in those times could be one hundred and eighty million years,
sometimes more.
It took a soul ten to twelve eras of light to go from one place to another.
Crossing galaxies and universes was a monumental task.
This created the farming.
The beings imbued with founder technology woke up.
They became aggressive and defensive,
They started dividing territory and claiming space for themselves.
This is when the main reptilian species came.
They had conquered their own builder foundation technology,
their own places,
and they wanted to take over our area of the galaxy.
Our star cluster,
consisting of some seventy-seven stars,
was out of phase with reality.
It also had a lot defenses.
We had giant solar systems invisible to the reptilians.
They discovered technology to bring those stars into the phase for them.
They started invading us.
This started the Lemurian wars some fifty-five million years ago.
The first timeline paradox occurred at this time.
It started negative time travel in many solar systems across the galaxy.
This resulted in an counter-creational event.
This set everything back to the beginning.
The Lemurians tried it a second time.
They created another counter-creational event.
They did it a third and fourth time through the Atlanteans.
This is when Atlanteans figured out they were the same species as the Atlanteans in Europe.
They were each otherâ€™s ancestors.
Time travel created that paradox.
