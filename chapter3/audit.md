## AUDIT

The prime creator is like a mafia boss.
He sets up the new rules.
The system activates around the rule parameters.
Numerous classes of co-creators build out on the rules.
The prime creator waits for co-creators to go against the rules
&mdash;
betray him.
He doesn't need to know every move of the soldiers on the street.
He's the boss.
The co-creators are beings like us,
*I am* instances of various planets and systems in various densities.
The higher density co-creators can see everything below.
They have the advantage of greater perspective.
There's a catch.
The co-creators could not create if they didn't have the prime creator as an aspect of their being.
This gets tricky.
There are many ways to explain it metaphorically or allegorically,
which is usually the way it is done in creation stories,
but the time has arrived for a more literal definition.
The prime creator can only be objectified by a subjective experience,
a mystical experience.
Why?
Because the prime creator is everything,
including the co-creators.
Therefore,
if you reason it through,
the prime creator has to be the good and bad in order to balance the ever-present corruption.
Corruption can be corrupted.
You have to be the antithesis of it,
the opposite of corruption
&mdash;
honest,
transparent,
sharing,
good.
