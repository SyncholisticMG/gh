## Global Narrative

The theories with which astronomers and scientists explain the origins of the universe are bunk.
Most hallowed information in the public space is disjointed.
We might get the right details in the wrong context,
the wrong context with the right details,
or any number of percentages of either.
Deception is a long practiced craft on this planet.
It's a dividend of the great forgetting,
the disconnection from source initiated by our birth on this planet.
These deceptions,
largely centered around information anemia
&mdash;
plus a host of techniques to lower our frequency
&mdash;
create and sustain belief engines.
This has fractured the unity between cosmology,
science,
and spirituality.
They don't want a unified knowledge system.
Knowledge is licensed and sold back to us.
It's a slave economy,
but the belief engines inhibit this realization.

In order to understand the complexity of creation,
a unified view of the holographic nature of reality is required.
This exists outside the linear and beyond scientific sets of equations.
We first need to understand time.
Time and the nature of reality as a holographic system that evolves,
adapts,
changes content and rules,
and simultaneously updates events in the past,
present and future.
Time is a social agreement
&mdash;
a paradox with different timelines,
time genocide,
creational and non-creational events
&mdash;
and,
as such,
the history we know it is incomplete,
falsified,
and subject to change in the years to come.

We need to look at time from the bigger perspective.
The consciousness of our sun continuously expands.
It's the total sine-wave of consciousness that represents our solar system,
and it's spiraling around the galactic central sun.
This means we can go a little faster.
Time gets redefined at this point because our concept of time is very distorted.
A time frame stated in a book is not a reliable reference.
Time doesnâ€™t work linearly.
History changes depending on what timeline we're observing.
Time is a social agreement.
How many calendars do we have in this world?
We entangle with many variations of time:
universal time,
Greenwich Mean Time,
Daylight-Savings Time.
Time is no longer a universal concept.
When we look at events in the past we need to take time travel,
time line genocide,
and hijacking of events by time interference into consideration.
The time wars have been centered in power,
control,
and dominance.
