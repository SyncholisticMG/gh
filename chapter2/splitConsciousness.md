## Splitting Consciousness


The soul can be split.
We can be taken out of our original bodies and put into *simulated bodies* somewhere else.
Consciousness can then be broken into hundreds of different fractals.
The fractals may then be spread throughout time with individual missions.
These are soul shards of yourself,
not *I am* selves,
bigger than normal shard pieces.
They remain connected to the *I am* selves,
but they are just pieces of an *I am* shattered into many pieces.
The split the piece itself still has access to the divine hologram,
though the shards are often convinced otherwise by the practitioners of this dark abuse.
