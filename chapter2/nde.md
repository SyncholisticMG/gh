## Near Death


Near Death Experience (NDE) is part of spiritual contract to allow you to see who,
what,
and where you've been in the life time since your first breath.
It might also be your past and future lives intersecting.
We often meet our guides,
guardians,
and others in the NDE.
The body has to go through the trauma of the death ritual.
The aura somewhat pops and the contained life force starts leaving the body.
After the pop there's a vacuum of energy.
The body must produce more etheric
&mdash;
chi,
prani,
orgone,
to name a few monikers it goes by
&mdash;
energy and maintain it to stay alive.
The final breaths use the body’s last alchemical fuel it's had from birth.
The brain loses the interconnectivity with the organs.
The organs remain a part of the divine hologram.
The *I am* begins to disintegrate its structure.
We go back to the ocean of awareness.
We may have attachments to who we have been in previous lifetimes.
This triggers life reviews and direct healing of the body.
We connect back into the original blue print of health.
Some people have visions of places and spaces of potential to refill the soul’s capacity.
Going through this transcendence phase it's vital to maintain the auric bubble around ourselves.
If not we drain out our life force energy.
We can come back from a NDE an educated,
illuminated being.
Some people come back with abilities they didn't have before the NDE,
the ability to play the piano,
for example.
It's a change in spiritual contract underwriting the incarnation
&mdash;
a new set of DNA based purposes.
This is not a walk in experience.
Walk ins are extremely rare and often get misidentified with NDEs.


NDE experiences take us out of time space equations because we move into the ocean of awareness then back to our life.
Once we lose connection to the organs it's just the vagus nerve and the spinal column reporting data the body has gone through.
We are disconnected from the hologram because we are no longer supported by the aura.
You can’t maintain the internal energy flow.
It flows out of the body.
Once we lose the bubble around us we are no longer in the shared reality rules.
We waver between many different worlds including the ocean of awareness as our ancestral connection.
The sea of consciousness is more for the many dreamers traveling back and forth,
contracted with us on linear and non-linear scales to ensure we stay invested in an era of light and don’t check out before our time.

As we leave time and space,
depending on the kind of NDE we have,
we can go to a high density dimensional realm.
This is when the fetus in the womb had a grand goal not yet achieved.
We can be sent to seventh  or eighth density to experience life from there then return with some of those potent memories intact.
Often people are so overwhelmed by the experience.
They are overwhelmed by their light being.
It becomes an expression of their self they fear they can't live up to.
We can live the light body.
It's already who we are.
The NDE shows us that.
Those experiences are contracted out in the fetus womb plan.


Bystanders sometimes accompany the soul when meeting loved ones on the other side.
Life reviews can be seen as random moments,
even though everything has an underlying universal order.
When one has a life review as part of their NDE it is about the spiritual contracts,
help to grow beyond them because the soul,
in the internal and external infrastructure,
hasn’t been able to resolve the issues.
The fetus in the womb plans all sets of experiences,
including the NDE.

When doctors or nurses or family members perceive light leaving the body that can be the etheric,
the life force leaving the body at the end of the transition process.
This is actually a verifiable phenomenon.
The energy has light mass.
The body is twenty to twenty-two grams lighter after death.
It all depends on how the life and death experience is planned in the fetus.
Some people have mystical deaths.
These deaths are another way of assisting others to mend broken faith.
One such death was the Catholic mystic and Trappist monk,
Thomas Merton,
who died in a freak accident coming out of the shower,
falling,
reaching to a fan for support,
then electrocuting himself through faulty wiring in the fan.
He was attending an inter-faith conference in Thailand.
The Buddhist monks hosting the conference immediately defined it as a mystical death.
The terminology was not invented for Merton's passing.
The mystical death is one of four types of death in Buddhist teaching.
