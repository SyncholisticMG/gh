## Personal Effort

We all have the birthright of celestial mediumship.
Our ability to inherit our birthright is conditional.
We must focus on mastering ourselves,
healing ourselves,
and nurturing ourselves toward our inheritance.
When I say inheritance I mean it literally
&mdash;
the sins of the father,
the wheel of karma
&mdash;
it's all inherited from our genetics,
but so is our greatness once we break the confines of family and culture.
Our true genetic inheritance is galactic and universal.
This is the greatest secret of the human race.
This is why distraction is the main tool of the enemy,
anything to keep us from our true inheritance.

You have to be committed.
All progress comes down to the ways we integrate consciousness expansion with our daily life.
The daily tasks are good,
observation of self and its relationship to the grander design,
contemplation of the mysteries,
but it all must be done with the goal of sovereignty to make it work inside you.
It's what this is all about,
becoming the true self you are that knows itself in all dimensions and realms.
As the sages of various paths have said,
you must want it as you want breath.
It must be vital to you.
This is the chief characteristic of the acolyte,
the need to know,
to prove to yourself once and for all the soul is an immortal part of the prime creator,
as a drop of water is a part of the sea,
and the sea flows out into the ocean of awareness.
We have access to the Akashic  records at our disposal.
This is the true reference library for all events,
past and future.
There are no gatekeepers.
There is no conspiracy.
It's your birthright as a human being.


As we are more and more in the state of celestial mediumship,
we get more information.
It's the dividend of being able to stay at a certain frequency for sustained periods of time.
The expanded consciousness blends into the moment.
We become occupants of a multidimensional here and now,
with information coming in through the celestial mediumship,
while we are are fully in the here and now,
walking around and performing our daily routine.


We can’t stay in high frequency all the time.
We have to consciously step down from those high states,
otherwise we’d vibrate out of this reality and all the work would be lost.
Coming back into the body and being present is vital.
This is why so many internal paths developed external exercises,
like Chinese or Indian yoga to accompany the deep meditation,
the centering and grounding of consciousness through physical exertion,
concentration,
respiration,
and movement.
This is grounding of energy,
no different than electrical grounding.
How to be present in all the innumerable worlds and times is achieved by realizing we are not meant to stay in states of high frequency.
We are not to disrupt the blueprint in fetus plan.
It makes it easier and simpler to come back and enjoy this reality.
Now changing states is as effortless as breathing.
