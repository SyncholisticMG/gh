## Personal Effort



We all have the birthright of celestial mediumship.
Our ability to inherit our birthright is conditional.
We must focus on mastering ourselves,
healing ourselves,
and nurturing ourselves toward our inheritance.
When I say inheritance I mean it literally
&mdash;
the sins of the father,
the wheel of karma
&mdash;
it's all inherited from our genetics,
but so is our greatness once we break the confines of family and culture.
Our true genetic inheritance is galactic and universal.
This is the greatest secret of the human race.
This is why distraction is the main tool of the enemy,
anything to keep us from our true inheritance.

You have to be committed.
All progress comes down to the ways we integrate consciousness expansion with our daily life.
The daily tasks are good,
observation of self and its relationship to the grander design,
contemplation of the mysteries,
but it all must be done with the goal of sovereignty to make it work inside you.
It's what this is all about,
becoming the true self you are that knows itself in all dimensions and realms.
As the sages of various paths have said,
you must want it as you want breath.
It must be vital to you.
This is the chief characteristic of the acolyte,
the need to know,
to prove to yourself once and for all the soul is an immortal part of the prime creator,
as a drop of water is a part of the sea,
and the sea flows out into the ocean of awareness.
We have access to the akashic  records at our disposal.
This is the true reference library for all events,
past and future.
There are no gatekeepers.
There is no conspiracy.
It's your birthright as a human being.


As we are more and more in the state of celestial mediumship,
we get more information.
It's the dividend of being able to stay at a certain frequency for sustained periods of time.
The expanded consciousness blends into the moment.
We become occupants of a multidimensional here and now,
with information coming in through the celestial mediumship,
while we are are fully in the here and now,
walking around and performing our daily routine.


We can’t stay in high frequency all the time.
We have to consciously step down from those high states,
otherwise we’d vibrate out of this reality and all the work would be lost.
Coming back into the body and being present is vital.
This is why so many internal paths developed external exercises,
like Chinese or Indian yoga to accompany the deep meditation,
the centering and grounding of consciousness through physical exertion,
concentration,
respiration,
and movement.
This is grounding of energy,
no different than electrical grounding.
How to be present in all the innumerable worlds and times is achieved by realizing we are not meant to stay in states of high frequency.
We are not to disrupt the blueprint in fetus plan.
It makes it easier and simpler to come back and enjoy this reality.
Now changing states is as effortless as breathing.


Physical movement entangles us with individual and collective consciousness,
oscillating between explicate and implicate.
We change environment and move through different levels of consciousness.
We alter the existing.
Our consciousness is acted upon by fluctuating fields of electromagnetic energy.
Epigenetics discovered our genes are made up of fifty percent DNA and fifty percent protein.
Genes are not self-actualizing.
The proteins comprise the structure of the human body,
defining shape and influencing behavior in an ongoing attempt to balance charge and polarity from the environment.

Our individual bubble of reality gets enriched in experience and memory through the journey on the celestial neural pathway.
We go from one hologram to another in the expansion we call the orchestra of consciousness.
The neural pathways are an assemblage of proteins that move the body and help it to function.
We all know how to walk through this reality.
The celestial mind generates the divine holograms through which our bodies have experience.
All living consciousness is part of the symphony.
The light and sound which creates and sustains all the realities allows us to manage a fractal of it which we call our reality.
Our very reality on an individual by individual basis is a co-created reality between us and the material of the hologram itself,
sound and light,
which sustains our physical and inner existence.
Our dreams are expressed in sound and light.
There are fractals within fractals.
Culture is another fractal,
whether it be a pueblo in a mountain village in Colombia,
or the frenetic consumerism inspired by Madison Avenue.
It's a hologram overlaying and interacting with your personal hologram.
It binds us to an era of history.
Our culture has Roman numeral time,
which is not our true accurate time stamp.
It may use elements of it,
though.
Our culture binds us to an era of history.
It's part of the hologram of resolution.
Our entanglement into the culture’s hologram of roman numeral time builds up a weave into the individual hologram.


The soul can be split.
We can be taken out of our original bodies and put into *simulated bodies* somewhere else.
Consciousness can then be broken into hundreds of different fractals.
The fractals may then be spread throughout time with individual missions.
These are soul shards of yourself,
not *I am* selves,
bigger than normal shard pieces.
They remain connected to the *I am* selves,
but they are just pieces of an *I am* shattered into many pieces.
The split the piece itself still has access to the divine hologram,
though the shards are often convinced otherwise by the practitioners of this dark abuse.
