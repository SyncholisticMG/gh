## Crystallization


During the awakening,
it's vital that our DNA crystallizes.
It's so new strands of awareness have the fluidity to grow,
like a plant,
and create solid neural pathways into many different dimensions.
In a sense,
we are the future us.
and there will be another future us who is a lot closer to the *awakening*,
and our stream of light lengthens from an alpha to a theta pattern.
When our wavelength lengthens,
the experience becomes more dense and rich.
Full fluidity means no internal limitations of spirit stopping us from creating incredibly potent memories backed by faith and spirit.
By manifesting the dream as a tangible feeling,
people can taste,
touch,
know,
sense,
smell,
feel,
and experience.
Many people taste hearing,
or hear through taste,
or both.
When it becomes a tangible experience,
it has many unseen languages behind it,
defining it more by making the dream-space tangible here and now.
It's that journey.
Make everything real now.
Open up the akashic records,
here and now,
in this moment.
Then it can be crystallized into our greater form of growth.
It's not just observation.
Sometimes the lineage has the awareness built into it,
and people go through awakening based off time locked experiences.

Crystals and rocks are communities of beings that are part of the sea of consciousness,
too.
Crystals are part of the implicate and explicate order,
simultaneously entangled and unentangled.
We can imprint entangled narrative perceptions and agendas upon crystals with our precognitive workforce.
A crystal will do what it needs to do for us based off how our precognitive workforce manifests the matter.
They are part of the ocean of awareness that becomes part of the sea of consciousness as animated matter.
Crystal allows us access to the ocean of awareness and the sea of consciousness based on our capacity to perceive,
receive,
process,
and manifest it.
The crystalline structure is materialized,
no longer a fluid ocean of awareness or sea of consciousness.
When we enter the sixth and seventh dimensions,
crystallization is the lower end technology for generating matter based awareness.
