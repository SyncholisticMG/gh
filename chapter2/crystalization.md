## Crystallization


During the awakening,
it's vital that our DNA crystallizes.
It's so new strands of awareness have the fluidity to grow,
like a plant,
and create solid neural pathways into many different dimensions.
In a sense,
we are the future us.
and there will be another future us who is a lot closer to the *awakening*,
and our stream of light lengthens from an alpha to a theta pattern.
When our wavelength lengthens,
the experience becomes more dense and rich.
Full fluidity means no internal limitations of spirit stopping you from creating incredibly potent memories backed by faith and spirit.
By manifesting the dream as a tangible feeling,
people can taste,
touch,
know,
sense,
smell,
feel,
and experience.
Many people taste hearing,
or hear through taste,
or both.
When it becomes a tangible experience,
it has many unseen languages behind it,
defining it more by making the dream-space tangible here and now.
It's that journey.
Make everything real now.
Open up the akashic records,
here and now,
in this moment.
Then it can be crystallized into our greater form of growth.
It's not just observation.
Sometimes the lineage has the awareness built into it,
and people go through awakening based off time locked experiences.
