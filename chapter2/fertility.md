## Fertility and Spirituality


There's an eye in the heart often activated through child birth.
Women can see through this eye in the same manner we see through the third eye in the forehead,
the imagination center.
The menstrual cycle is a way for the rods and cones to align with the third eye plus the ones in the heart,
rectum,
or clitoris,
all extensions of the third eye.
A man’s third eye can travel to the tip of the penis and connect into the womb portal from there.
Menstrual cramps and pains are often a sign of being out of alignment in those areas.
A most beneficial prayer technique for women during their cycle is to call in all their thoughts,
ideas,
constructs,
and energies from previous menstruation cycles and detach from them on a month to month basis.
These powerful times for women are being high jacked and bastardized by the global narrative.
The menstrual blood is very powerful as an energy of being a negotiator,
an arbitrator,
or peacemaker.


Menstruation continues after menopause.
Women still go through the cycle without blood.
The fertility spirits attached to menopause move on to a higher density.
The DNA is no longer producing the unique experience of bleeding,
but the spiritual mechanics remain the same,
even more intensified through menopause.
In most cases when women experience heavy menopausal symptoms,
they're actually giving birth in other simultaneous realities which need the births.
Their remaining fertile life alters versions of themselves who didn’t get pregnant.
Using their biological clock,
they find a signature frequency match to complete interdimensional birthing as part of their karmic resolution.



Hot flashes can happen when an alternate version of the woman is breaking water and is more than likely going to die from the birth.
they are transferring chemical life force based on their experience to avoid this.
A hot flash can also be another version of you,
in another place and time,
and in an alien form,
in which the birth got difficult.
Birthing is part of karmic resolution.
This is important to remember.
Through strands of awareness in the DNA,
the connective tissues transfer life force to assist in that birth by another simultaneous version of yourself who lacks fertility power or lives in an environment with no fertility at all.
This allows the mystical births to happen,
the babies who should never have survived or lived.
Evening primrose oil is one of the natural remedies for hot flashes.
This plant oil is harvested as an essence to lessen the effect in this reality and,
at the same time,
it amplifies the experience on the unseen side.



Some strands in the DNA need a special chemical soup in the body to activate fertility.
It used to be manipulated in the overall chemistry of the body.
Other strands had more opportunities to awaken.
When a woman who never gave birth is going through a very difficult time during menopause,
another version of her simultaneous existence is going through a birthing experience.
They are both be intrinsically linked to reduce the negative effect.
There are times when co-living souls go through menopause together,
This generates new life in celestial nurseries.
It gives birth to a new soul frequency in the ocean of awareness.
The new soul frequency begins the journey into the sea of consciousness and manifests in time and space.

The fatty deposits around the midline during menopause serve as a protective membrane,
but it can block good experiences with regards to working with a woman’s residual image.
Once the biological fertility clock stops ticking,
the *awareness clock* takes over.
We can gain a greater awareness and perspective of the awakening.
We can experience mood swings when the body is trying to find the right chemistry.
It's a balance between overproducing and underproducing hormones and chemicals.


Men go through menopause too,
and they also have their individual process through cycles of creation.
As they actualize their physical manifestations,
a house,
artwork,
business,
what have you,
they leave their legacy for their clan,
tribe,
nation.
Men build an archive of experience that stays manifested in time and space.
Lineages in the unseen can plan lives through the infrastructure created by the urge of manifestation.
Men reach their sexual peak around the age of eighteen.
Women reach their peak in their thirties.
This is why it's important for the infrastructure in the unseen to be planned.
The cycles have been manipulated by DNA farming.
If the human reproductive cycle was not manipulated,
most pregnancies would be eighteen to twenty-four months.
In some instances it can be up to five years.
In the past,
the umbilical cord wouldn’t be cut for months.
This allowed more bonding between the partners.
There was more opportunity for the father to have ritual connection to the child through the mother as the medium of the connection.

Testosterone drives creativity in men.
There are other things similar to testosterone that drive construction.
A male scientist doesn’t use testosterone,
but he uses another version of it,
a mental aspect of the testosterone.
There's no scientific name for it yet in this reality.
There are several hundred forms of testosterone,
each with a different chemical chain that allows a different aspect of creation.
Through manipulation of our bodies we are not producing the all encompassing testosterone which keeps us in fight,
flight,
or freeze.
Our glands have been manipulated to produce one strand of testosterone over the other which leads us back to the cerebellum in the motor cortex.



The birth control pill is manufactured from giant farms of female horses.
The urine of a pregnant horse is the chemical basis of the birth control pill.
The horses are pregnant their entire life.
Their colts are taken and chopped up into horse meat sold to pet food manufacturers and fast food restaurants.
The entire industry revolves around the urine of pregnant horses for human birth control pills.
Many women reject the different types of pills.
There's a malaise associated with the pill they can feel.
They become worse and worse until they get the birth control pill out of their lives.
Before the horse urine birth control pill there were plenty of natural herbal remedies to stop pregnancy.
Like most lineage medicine
&mdash;
ayurveda,
traditional Chinese medicine,
homeopathy,
naturopathy,
and others
&mdash;
it was delegitimized and marginalized by the big allopathic medical footprint that coincided with the big push into the twentieth century economy,
in which everything was patented,
synthetically replicated,
restricted to *licensed* practitioners,
taxed
and brought into the mercantile system.
