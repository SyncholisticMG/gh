## Celestial Medium Journey


The journey to celestial medium begins with self-mastery by daily practice,
which becomes a monthly practice,
a yearly practice,
then a constant practice,
a function as ingrained as breathing.
A celestial medium expands consciousness to become a translator of the *blue road of spirit*,
knowledge of the spirit and the ancestry working with you.


Mastering the finite *I am* while acknowledging the infinite *I am* creates the medium space by which consciousness skirts the sides of infinite and finite.
The celestial medium takes up the million letter alphabet in this space,
compresses it with their precognitive workforce,
and uploads to the implicate *I am*.
The explicate *I am*
&mdash;
the incarnation
&mdash;
consciously downloads it to process and manifest.
It then returns the data back to the implicate *I am*
&mdash;
the being in the sea of consciousness within the ocean of awareness
&mdash;
uploading back to the universe.
The human mind and body can't hold the information forever.
This is the back and forth method between the implicate and explicate *I am* through the process of the celestial medium.

There is a receive,
respond,
retain,
release process in passing higher frequency information from the body's perspective.
Bring it into the body.
Unpack it.
Decode it.
This avails the data to your higher frequency level.
The packed information goes up to the crown chakra and back to the original source
&mdash;
the frequency pattern of the universe around us.


We are incarnate life forms here now.
We are not up there in the celestial realms.
It creates distortion in us if we hold on to it.
Many channelers end up corrupt because they donâ€™t let go of the information.
They hoard it.
The distortions lie unconsciousness in their bodies.
It can lead to possession.
There are external sources that want to possess bodies hoarding information.
They dissolve the information into pure energy and feed on it.
Letting go of that information is one-hundred percent conscious effort.
We must say,
I am packing this information back up,
knowing full well that I cannot hold on to it,
and then release it back to the universe.
