## Celestial Medium Journey


The journey to celestial medium begins with self-mastery by daily practice,
which becomes a monthly practice,
a yearly practice,
then a constant practice,
a function as ingrained as breathing.
A celestial medium expands consciousness to become a translator of the *blue road of spirit*,
knowledge of the spirit and the ancestry working with you.


Mastering the finite *I am* while acknowledging the infinite *I am* creates the medium space by which consciousness skirts the sides of infinite and finite.
The celestial medium takes up the million letter alphabet in this space,
compresses it with their precognitive workforce,
and uploads to the implicate *I am*.
The explicate *I am*
&mdash;
the incarnation
&mdash;
consciously downloads it to process and manifest.
It then returns the data back to the implicate *I am*
&mdash;
the being in the sea of consciousness within the ocean of awareness
&mdash;
uploading back to the universe.
The human mind and body can't hold the information forever.
This is the back and forth method between the implicate and explicate *I am* through the process of the celestial medium.

There is a receive,
respond,
retain,
release process in passing higher frequency information from the body's perspective.
Bring it into the body.
Unpack it.
Decode it.
This avails the data to your higher frequency level.
The packed information goes up to the crown chakra and back to the original source
&mdash;
the frequency pattern of the universe around us.


We are incarnate life forms here now.
We are not up there in the celestial realms.
It creates distortion in us if we hold on to it.
Many channelers end up corrupt because they don’t let go of the information.
They hoard it.
The distortions lie unconsciousness in their bodies.
It can lead to possession.
There are external sources that want to possess bodies hoarding information.
They dissolve the information into pure energy and feed on it.
Letting go of that information is one-hundred percent conscious effort.
We must say,
I am packing this information back up,
knowing full well that I cannot hold on to it,
and then release it back to the universe.



Our bodies adapt and evolve in this celestial medium process.
We can’t really say we're both
&mdash;
an incarnate life form and a non *I am* on the celestial medium side,
which perceives time in a much longer length.
Whatever agenda the micro-soul has.
it's dwarfed compared to the celestial medium's length of time.
The agendas don’t match through length of time,
but they are both in equal experience simultaneously.
You experience the super long game of the celestial mind,
and the long game of the *I am*.
It works with the higher spirit to be in the medium space.
From the medium space it transfers the *allness* of the *I am* into the code,
downloads the code,
returns to the *I am* state,
manifests with the code,
then puts the code back into the celestial space.
We simultaneously experience local time to super long galactic time,
going back and forth,
the finite and infinite *I am* equally and continuously changing frequency without competition for temporal dominance.


### Reincarnation of Celestial Mind




A self-spawned celestial medium is a planet’s translator,
able to speak to and communicate with other celestial minds,
and it translates from the higher frequency to the lower density energy,
allowing everyone to understand the common messages.
The seventh-dimensional seed planet as a celestial medium is a bit different.
Celestial mediums can exist on every planet,
wherever there's a celestial mind.
A lot of celestial mediums will spawn before a planet's demise,
right before the light goes out.
This has happened on other worlds.
To save their own life force,
the celestial mediums travel into the future,
to an endpoint of its consciousness,
just before the light of the planet
&mdash;
the literal stream of energy
&mdash;
fades out completely.
They locate the front point of their earliest celestial mind and absorb it,
then they seed their celestial mind on another planet.

The life of celestial minds is inspiring,
like everything else in creation.
It's really just one thing happening at different levels.
Just as the white wisp of seedling leaves the dandelion with the slightest wind at just the right time in its cycle,
so too are the seeds of celestial minds blown from one field to another,
one world to another in this scale.
It's just life.
No different than the turnings of nature here.
Celestial minds have their own astral worlds.
They have their own life reviews.
They possess a variety of means to stave off death,
natural processes by which something is spawned from their world.
