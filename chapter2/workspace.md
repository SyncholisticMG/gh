Q: What about the manipulation through birth control pill and the water contamination through it? Do you know what modern birth control pill is? Giant farms of female horses that are forever pregnant and they harvest the urine which is being used as birth control.
The pill is basically based off a slave pregnancy regime.
A horse doesn’t have a choice to get pregnant or not.
They are literally pregnant for their entire life and then has its offerings taken and chopped up into horse meat and the urine for pills.
That’s why so many women reject the different types of pills and it becomes detrimental to their wellbeing.
Before there was the horse urine based pill there were plenty of natural herbal remedies to stop pregnancy.
They stopped using them to pattern a pill and start charging for them.

	REINCARNATION / DNA / LIFE REVIEW / NEAR DEATH EXPERIENCES
Q: What is the reincarnation process from a DNA perspective? DNA is 80 percent memoires.
That's one of the first fundamental understandings science and spirituality are going to have to come to terms with.
We live in a reality of photonic light that has a bunch of rules in it that says how photonic light beings incarnate,
express and exchange,
and when they pass on,
how they express and exchange in another scale.
And the DNA is the encoding or the soul,
or the light body is the cypher that uncodes and unpacks the experience.

And as we come back,
and many times over,
to the same type of living,
after a while we store memories in DNA lineages,
and this is how we go to the immortality aspect,
where we keep getting born into a lineage that has our own memories in it,
and has our regular soul family incarnation process in it,
so we can become bigger and greater beings of divinity and light.
We also live in a time where they do not teach of our DNA lineage.
They teach of mathematics and DNA and RNA and how it can be easily changed and altered.
Well,
that is true because DNA is still light in another form.
It's visible on one spectrum and invisible on another spectrum.
When our consciousness reaches the peak of where we are right now in our cells there's a part of our super consciousness that's working with this reality,
constantly encoding every micro second of fraud time into light into our memory.
Memory is not physical.
Memory,
is it tangible? Is it electronic? It's a form of light that has to be stored into an experience.
​​​​​​​We,
as streams of consciousness have thousands of sub carrier codes of millions of different experiences inside us.
And all we have to do is tune into that memory and we can go into that stream of experience at any scale we desire using a variety of tools.

Q: What is the other 20 percent of the DNA referring to? Our forms are programmed to harmony – that other 20% of our DNA that is not necessarily entangled with Consciousness.
Around 7% is made up of harmony,
frequency,
vibration and the remaining 13% corresponds to how the spiritual codes and contracts unfold in linear and none-linear time.
What agencies you work or don’t work with as well as how no-time beings can consciously entangle with the time based you to create a brand new contract that is need for change,
auditing of the self.


Q: Is this also the part of the DNA that refers to the Precognitive Workforce? Yes,
and There's a precognitive and postcognitive workforce also.
The PRECOGS are aligning the infinite set of choices,
the plan A,
B,
C… the choices for this particular moment.
POSTCOGNITIVE WORKFORCE is fixing some of the perception mistakes so that There's a clear line of understanding that There's a past,
present and future and the evolution of thought into constructism itself.
All that is happening based on the choices that we are making here in time.
There are choices that we make that are outside of time too as celestial mediums and at whatever higher state of awareness we choose to emanate at that moment,
yes

Q: What is a Near Death Experience (NDE)? A near death experience would be part of spiritual contract to allow you to see who,
what,
where you have been this life time since you took your first breath aided by your mother’s placenta in her womb.
It can be an account of your past and future lives intersecting,
losing or gaining potentials on the journey of your soul.
People often meet their guides and guardians and others they have met during their lifespan.
In order for it to be considered a near death experience the body has to still go through the trauma of it.
It's when the aura somewhat pops in a metaphorical sense and the initially contained life force start excuding the body.
After that pop There's this vacuum of energy where the body must produce more chi and maintain it to stay alive.
The last breaths are using up the body’s last alchemical fuel from birth.
In the NDE the brain loses the interconnectivity with the organs whilst the organs still remain a part of the hologram.
The *I am*ness begins to disintegrate its technological structure and you go back to the Ocean of Awareness where you may have lasting attachments to who you have been in previous lifetimes.
This can trigger life reviews and direct healings of the body connecting you back into the original blue print of health.
Some people have visions of all different places and spaces of potentialities to refill the soul’s capacity.
Going through this transcendence phase it's vital to maintain that auric bubble around themselves to not drain out their life force energy  There are times when you come back from a NDE as an educated illuminated being meaning the other side taught you something very specific.
It's a change in spiritual contracts,
with a new set of DNA based coded purposes.
This is not necessarily a walk in experience as walk ins are extremely rare and often get misidentified with NDEs.


Q: Is it true to say that we are leaving time & space when going through a NDE? Yes,
with a NDE you are leaving the timespace equation as you are moving into the Ocean of Awareness and then from there you come back.
Once you lose connection to the organs and it's just the vagus nerve and the spinal column reporting data the body has gone through enough shut down to facilitate that.
What essentially happens is that you are disconnected from the hologram because you are not supported by the aura anymore.
You can’t maintain that internal energy flow,
it just keeps flowing out of the body.
Once we lost that bubble around us we are no longer in the shared reality rules and begin to waver between many different worlds including the Ocean of Awareness,
as our ancestral connection.
The Sea of Consciousness is more for the many dreaming beings travelling back and forth,
contracted with you on linear and non-linear scales,
so that you stay invested in an era of light and don’t check out before your time.

As you are leaving time and space,
depending on what kind of NDE you have,
you can go to a very high density and dimensional realm.
This is when the fetus in the womb had a grand goal that you had not achieved yet and you can be sent to 7th  or 8th density to experience life from there and then return with some of those potent memories intact.
Often people are so overwhelmed by the experience and think they can’t live up to that energy being that they perceived themselves as.
And the message is that you can as it's already who you are and the NDE has assisted you to discover that.
Those experiences would be contracted out beforehand in the fetus in the womb planning.

Bystanders can sometimes accompany that soul through the experience of meeting loved ones on the other side be that now in NDE or death scenario.
Life reviews can be seen as random moments,
even though everything has an underlying universal order.
When one has a life review as part of their NDE it was to close the spiritual contracts and grow beyond them because the soul in the internal and external infrastructure hasn’t been able to resolve those issues.
It also helps the understanding of the existential structure of how the fetus in the womb plans all sets of experiences including traumas,
dramas,
karmas,
dharmas.
Often when doctors,
nurses or family members perceive light leaving the body that can be the chi,
the lifeforce leaving the body at the end of the transition process.
It all depends on how the life & death experience has been orchestrated in the fetus planning.
It does happen that people have magical unique deaths as another way of assisting their loved ones to mend broken faith,
accept the mystical in front of them and ease them into the griefing process.

Q: What is the difference between a NDE to an Outer Body Experience (OBE)? OBEs are generally astral travel which is very different to  NDE.
The astral body still has the auric bubble intact and keeps storing chi within the hologram.

Q: How come people can literally feel pain and think thoughts when going through a NDE? In a life review you have lost enough of your *I am* to perceive incidents from all different angles,
sides and different points of view at the same time.
So yes,
you may experience the pain you have inflicted onto others as if being in their bodies as well as feel the sensations of others during interactions with you.
You may also find yourself having an array of thoughts as many NDE’s report.
Remember,
thoughts have an electro chemical frequency that use the body’s base electro magnetic frequency as a storage system.
This is how it creates a linear time stamp.
Through those near death experiences the body releases those energies hence they come into the forefront of your awareness.
As an infinite being in the Ocean of Awareness you can still experience those feeling as part of the transition process.
The physical reactions can help people to acknowledge and give meaning and resolution to their experience once they return from a NDE.
As the body takes the last breaths There's a chemical reaction going on for as much as seven days afterwards,
still a form of attachment,
a process of letting go of the frequency of thoughts and feelings.
In many mourning rituals you stay with the dead body to honour and witness the letting go journey of all the karmas and dharmas as an alchemical form of resolution for the deceased as well as the family members.

Q: Can you say more on the life review outside of NDE?  The life review is part of the transition process and cannot be by passed,
we all have to do it.
When you are on the verge of death you don’t necessarily remember what to do and that is absolutely fine and normal.
There are people that understand the death as part of the ongoing journey and have prepared for it and then there are those who are in fear and panic.
Either way your state of mind at the time will be open to have your guides and guardians assist you to begin the life review.
Images of life long avoidance and the preciousness of life are being recognised through the dwindling of consciousness.
We can learn to value death as a new beginning,
a change of energy and consciousness,
instead of being afraid of it.
Can you allow that to be a part of your ongoing daily practice? Death is just a different level of awareness.
Your choices in this lifetime now will determine how much ease you will have with your life review.
The life you are participating now is precious and pregnant with possibilities to be experienced to the fullest.
The understanding of death can expand one’s consciousness and take away the fear.
At the end of the day death is an acceptance journey to ensure that you have lived your life without regrets,
without forcefully jeopardising your joy,
health and wellbeing The rest is instant gratification of uneducated mind that is in fear.

Q: Can bodies be trapped in false light? The process of capturing a soul right after it has left the body is technically a possibility but very unlikely to be practiced.
It requires a lot of energy and a developped infrastructure in place to put the soul essence into a simulated environment where it may have ancestors and then force it right back into the body with a limited or partial life review.
That is known as the false light technology.

Just like with ghost scenarios,
when going through life reviews one doesn’t necessarily have all the higher levels of awareness available.
A lot of times when the life review starts the soul is shattered into thousands of different shards and it's the oversoul that comes in and patches them back together.
It takes out the negative soul shards,
puts them into a secondary file where another fetus from another womb may use those soul shards from another life,
a past life and integrate it into the infinite fetus blueprint choice so that shard can get resolution in another lifetime.
Remember soul shards are not *I am*s.
There's help from the oversoul to have a greater experience through creating liftetime after lifetime.
We have access to the oversoul right now,
just a thought away,
will you believe it,
will you trust it?
Q: Can we become stuck in the reincarnation cycle? No,
we are not stuck in reincarnation.
We are incarnating and reincarnating and the first part of your life you maybe a reincarnating soul and if you break through the false propaganda you may be an incarnating soul.
Or you start as an incarnating soul,
run into a bunch of badass people that make you into a reincarnating soul,
repeating their karmas.
You can be both at the same time depending on the issues in the ancestral lineage of your family.

	THE JOURNEY TO CELESTIAL MEDIUMSHIP OF PEACE
Q: What is the CELESTIAL MEDIUM OF PEACE? When you have elevated yourself and you go through the journey of transferring the consciousness of your allness to become the celestial medium of peace.
It's operating in the physical,
the red and blue road as well as on the celestial road and its many brothers and sisters.

Q: What are celestial minds? We learn this through astrology,
how astrology and the different worlds can affect us.
We are working with celestial minds who are incarnating here in our world,
other worlds,
physical,
non-physical,
entangled and unentangled observers.
We begin to work collectively with them at the celestial medium level.
What needs to be resolved through peace at the minds of how the planets work.

Q: Is becoming a celestial medium of peace our birthright? Yes,
There's a linear process to it before it becomes fully non-linear.
The linear process is self-mastery,
understanding the length of your waveform,
how strong and potent you are so when you go through the conscious aware choice to become that celestial medium between the celestial minds and the surface minds for the generation of subject matters of peace.
You learn how to bring unique concepts of peace to places and space of time that are looking for that medium to inspire new layers of peace.

Q: As more people come into celestial mediumship how does that effect the global narrative? The global narrative will become more irrelevant to the greater growth of humanity.
Humanity will start realising that the global narrative is irrelevant to the bigger streams of time,
it has no staying power.
We will be detoxifying from roman numeral time and could probably enter a system of commerce beyond the Babylonian money course.
There are celestial commerce exchange systems that can allow matter to matter manifestations from one density to another.

Q: Will we all become celestial mediums of peace? No,
the celestial medium of peace purpose is a very narrow band in the general awakening.
The selfspawns had the contract to do it 20 or 40 years ahead of time so that it was seeded in the 3-5 previous generations so There's colloquial now presentation of the very concept.
You’ve got to create concepts and language that have a staying power so that there are general jumps creating the various bubbles of reality and the different levels of awareness and consciousness.
It prepares you ahead of time for when you then in the flow and it's not about any of the common topics of the global narrative distracting from a greater growth,
then celestial medium of peace will be there for anyone to connect with our planet.
Before you leave her world to become a a part of the greater group out there she’s got some stuff to tell you.
Just like covid is our story,
it’s a story we might relate to some Pleiadians around a fire.

   THE UNVANQUISHED DREAM OF PEACE
Q: What is meant with the APPARATUS OF INFINITE INTERCONNECTIVITY – THE HUB OF INTERCONNECTIVITY? The apparatus of infinite interconnectivity is the many simultaneous existing selves who create the network between themselves that form the hub of interconnectivity.
It's also part of your pre- and post cognitive workforce.
The UNVANQUISHED DREAM is an aspect of the apparatus which then gives you even greater connection to all the versions of yourself who are sharing that perspective.
THE UNVANQUISHED DREAMER OF PEACE comes in here too.
Its purpose is to connect to and interconnect to all the forgotten and remembered oceans of awareness and many seas of consciousness that are in the multiverse which is layered on top of all the forms of thought and awareness and to connect them in a single time-space location in which they can manifest the wordsmith creation.

Q: Can you go into the mechanics of our precognitive workforce,
how it works and how we can best use them to help us on the great journey to dream the great dream of peace? Our precognitive workforce is us that has the capacity to understand that we can create an infinite amount of conscious time travel versions of ourselves.
They can go into the future,
into the past and prepare a resource of knowledge and information that’s instantly called on as masterful manifestations of inspiration in the moment to out create anything that is a negative,
dampening,
sucking,
draining,
frequency within the system of domination and control.
Your *I am* precognitive workforce is all of your other versions of self that are simultaneously existing that have earned,
learned and relearned the rights of awareness.
That means that if you are choosing to be a spiritually aware being,
existing in all time-space equations and that you are contemplating all aspects of it.
There are frequencies out there that are not all positive.
You as this *I am* here now being make this declaration in your frequency that you are a being of equal cocreation,
non-competition,
non-hierarchical dreaming *I am* breakaway DNA light body civilisation of one who is here in this DNA form this lifetime.
You are now using the genuine work to make a great impact on those that you love,
your family,
your clan,
your nation,
your tribe and earth mother.
If you are choosing to do that on all scales you need a masterful precognitive workforce which is your birth right and legacy to create as a natural co-creative evolutionary being who is a part of the great dreamtime awakening.
You are using your responsibility to impact on the loves of your life,
the themes and ideologies that you are wishing to promote to others so that they can find their own self illumination and belief free from external gurus without sending them down the paths to false illumination.
Our precognitive workforce is there waiting to work with us,
to think with us,
to love with us,
to be part of our greater expression.
We must put the time,
effort,
energy into believing that we can call upon our inner geniuses from many dimensions,
timestreams,
galaxies and universes to form a forceful collective of all of us who are all part of this dreamtime awakening so we can free ourselves from the perception of limitation by the global narrative.

Q: Have shamans always used their precognitive workforce? Yes,
they just used them in their era of light or their theme of times.
Every generation learns from the previous one and the generation that follows interprets the next and then there are the rebel few who get back to the source of creation and look at that as their only interpretation.
That is where we understand we are all of our past,
present and future selves simultaneously existing.
You are a signature frequency match to your precognitive workforce and to the collective workforce of the highest forms of your light soul teachers,
all of the *I am*s that are a part of your great hall of Akashic Records.

Q: Would you be treading on someone’s journey if you sent out your precognitive workforce to help them in a co-creational way?  There’s always a fine line where too much is too much.
If the other being has no precognition or any form of understanding of what a precognitive workforce is then you will be stepping on their journey unless it's an infant or a young child who hasn’t formed an *I am* yet.
Most children don’t fully form the *I am* until puberty when their thymus gland creates 300 new forms of chemicals that suddenly floods the body to create puberty itself which solidifies the *I am* technology as a time-space equation.

Q: So where would they send out their precognitive workforce from,
what would be their source if they’re not *I am* aware? So first you would have a conversation with them where you are going to cojoin your precognitive workforces to create a manifestation of synchronicities that helps each of the beings cocreate an aspect that brings some form of inner inspiration and healing.
This is why healers become facilitators so that they can amalgamate their precognitive workforce with the natural precognitive workforce of the ill person who may not have any consciousness skills.
If those *I am* beings want to become true consciousness beings of choice they must learn the process of self-illumination.
There’s an infinite amount of teachers out there in the great dreamtime awakening .
Discover what’s the signature frequency match for you then go out,
evolve and create.
