Q: How do our bodies adapt,
evolve in this CELESTIAL MEDIUM process? We can’t really say that as we are both,
a incarnate life form and a non *I am* on the celestial medium side that perceives time in a much longer length.
Whatever AGENDA the micro soul has is dwarfed in comparison to the celestial mediums length of time.
The agendas don’t match via length of time but they are both in equal experience simultaneously.
You experience the super long game of the celestial mind and the long game of the *I am* who is working with the higher spirit to be in that medium space,
to transfer the allness of the IAM into the code,
download the code,
come back to the *I am* state,
manifest with it and then put the code back to the celestial space.
Simultaneously experience,
going from local time to super long galactic time.
Finite and infinite *I am* equally and continuously changing frequency harmony vibration without competing with each other.

Q: When you talk about AGENDAS,
what do you mean by that? There is a FOETUS agenda that is specific from lifetime to lifetime.
The AVATAR Agenda is evolving the greater soul’s capacity to generate light and have experiences over many thousands of *I am*s who have been foetuses.
There are times where the oversoul or the avatar gets stuck in repetition without elimination in servitude to a system which lowers its capacity to use light and it cannot expand.

Q: What is a non-agenda being? None agenda is when time is irrelevant to the great experience.
Linear time is not the focus of the agenda.
It may do one thing 28,
000 years ago,
17 things two years ago,
2Mio things 48 million years ago and that is technically a none agenda.
All these things that are being done in this non-agenda create a resolution for some agendas or apply potential solutions for agendas that are stuck that cannot move forward anymore.
Non-Agenda allows you to cut and paste time based experiences out of certain *I am* experiences and uses them temporarily in a new *I am* expression to manifest past or future none agenda aspects into a present agenda.

Q: Is the Crystallisation Process of the DNA part of the Celestial Medium Journey? During the awakening it is vital that our DNA becomes crystallised so that new strands of awareness,
consciousness can have the fluidity to grow much like a plant and can make solid neural pathways into the many different dimensions.
We are the future us….
And there will be another future you who is a lot closer to the ‘awakening’ and your stream of light will lengthen going from an alpha to a theta pattern.
When your wavelength lengthens the experience becomes more dense and rich.
Full fluidity means there are no internal limitations of spirit stopping you from creating incredibly potent memories that are backed by faith and spirit.
In these moments of now,
where we are making the ancient future present now in a dream,
what effect does that have on the unseen and everything you brought into this manifestation?
By manifesting the dream as a tangible feeling people can taste,
touch,
know,
sense,
smell,
feel and experience.
Many people taste hearing or hear via taste or both.
When it becomes a tangible experience it has many other unseen languages behind it that define it more by making that dreamspace tangible here now.
It is that journey.
Making everything real now,
open up the Akashic Records,
here now in the moment.
These words have been combined in a new way to allow a new set of geometric linguistics to unfold.
Then it can be crystallised into our greater form of growth.
It is not just observation but sometimes the lineage has the awareness built into it and people go through awakening based off time locked experiences.

Observation is also implicate order awareness.
Observation has been manipulated at a point when we were looking at energy beings who believed they were gods.
The observer effect should not have come so early in the crystallisation process in the system.
Some people can have a three sense observation and still access the Ocean of Awareness,
again the bloodline will influence that.
Free will is tainted by the bloodline.
Fluid like a planet we are growing the additional strands of awareness and at a certain level of acceptance and integration the Ocean of Awareness and the Sea of Consciousness crystallises and changes the bloodline.
This is the JOURNEY OF CELESTIAL MEDIUM – ‘I transfer the allness of myself to become the celestial medium,
I no longer need to grow in this narrative and the next narrative I grow is in the spiritual commerce network’.

Q: How can we work with the CELESTIAL MEDIUM without overidentifying with it? We are technically hypothetical beings and as such we can believe at many things at once but the universe is going to determine what is going to manifest through our wills.
This is where hypothetical then becomes *I am* BEING realised through engaging your belief engine that allows strands of awareness to influence intuition,
precognition and postcognition without competition and hierarchy.
A multidimensional aware being manifests into this 3rd dimension through creating tangible experiences by co-creating with the infinite celestial medium with the incarnate life form in the present here now.

Q: Sometimes I feel like *I am* watching from the distance without really jumping into the manifestation game.
What is that all about? These often are DNA urges,
influenced by the memories of the past,
that keep you from creating new experiences.
Most of us had billions of incarnations and it is vital to disconnect from those to reconnect with source in a new way to create new memories which is part of the awakening journey.
The many forms of dramatic source disconnections will influence how you perceive the journey into celestial medium,
agency or vehicle.

Q: Is this why we sometimes excessively identify with certain parts of our personal evolution journey? Identity as a myth is rarely explored but can hugely influence the way we experience life and how we create in it.
The more we identify,
in aware or unawareness,
with one part of our journey,
be that now as the grand earthly masters of manifestation or spiritual celestial mediums the more we limit ourselves and do not allow access to the full range of possibilities in the many existing holograms.

Buckminster Fuller immortalised the phrase,
“I seem to be a verb” when it came to considering identity.
He wrote,
“I live on Earth at present,
and I don’t know what *I am*.
I know that *I am* not a category.
*I am* not a thing—a noun.
I seem to be a verb,
an evolutionary process—an integral function of the universe.
”

Identity is a strange thing; thought itself is not static but a process of movement.
Let’s contemplate ‘*I am* A CELESTIAL MEDIUM’ here for a moment and the responsibility that comes with it at the level of one’s awareness.
When we replace ‘*I am* a celestial medium’ with ‘I UTILISE a celestial agency,
celestial forum or a celestial vehicle’ how does that responsibility change? By using a different metaphorical expression we are changing the very nature of the internal representation.
By looking at celestial mediumship from this different perspective you can change the way you are identifying with it and as such gain clarity and more ease on how you interact and work with it.

Ask yourself: What does Celestial Mediumship look like for me?
Is it a SHIP that helps you sail through the Ocean of Awareness,
the Sea of Consciousness?
Is it a VEHICLE,
you sit behind the wheel and drive through all levels of Consciousness?
Is it a BUILDING you construct,
add floors to hold space for people,
places,
*I am*s on this journey of awakening?
Is it a JOURNEY,
a continues venture taking you on a connection exploration through space time and beyond?

It is all about your unique individualised way how you internalise the subject matter at hand to break down the strands of information,
cognitise the data and make it *I am* self-realised.
Thoughts and thought constructs expressed in images,
metaphors can be added and alchemised into the rest of our awareness as an expression of being a multidimensional,
multifunctional being of photonic light.

Q: What does working in communion and union with earth as a celestial medium mean? It goes back to the known fundamentals:
-    	Self-mastery,
self-healing,
self-nurturing,
individual sovereignty to make it work inside you
-        Enthusiastic effort and letting go of curiosity learning and mental masturbation
-        Consciously absorbing the material and allowing true learning to occur
-        You have access to the Akash at your disposal; stop looking for external sources
As you are more and more in the state of celestial medium you are getting more information than before you could not stay in a particular density long enough before.
To be simultaneously here now is its own challenge.
There is a lot of inner work that evolves to maintain that density frequency.
You can’t stay there all the time.
We have to consciously step down from those high states,
otherwise you’d vibrate out of this reality and all the work would be lost.
Coming back into the body,
being present,
it is life changing,
healing,
revealing,
all those universal laws that we all have.
How to be present in a different way.
How to be present simultaneously in all these tens of millions of worlds and times.
Having understood the teaching that we are not meant to stay in those states of high frequency,
to not disrupt the blueprint in foetus plan,
does make it easier and simpler to come back and enjoy this reality.
Now changing states is effortless like breathing.

Conversations with collectives can be an ‘insult’ party with collectives without offending them to create a connective communicative language.
In the unlimited point of view there are a lot of ways to awaken faster without interfering.
We just have to figure it out how and then do a test implementation.
Give it to a collective,
that does a metaphorical double blind study to see if it is not interference,
and find a way for it to naturally co-exist in some form of implementation.
That’s me turning on those programs and let it go on autopilot.
We all do that.
Retrain your programs to be positive.
Turn off external stimulus,
reach the silence,
know that *I am* part of creating it all.
Which part do I want to focus on.
This will create a set of impulses generating simultaneous pre- and post cognition which is an ever evolving experience solely based in light or SUPER ILLUMINAL THINKING.

Q: What is super illuminal thinking? At that level of super illuminal thinking you completely bypass chemical based experiences in memories and you are no longer operating in the zeros and ones of the sympathetic and parasympathetic.
The vagus nerve is fully functional and all the chakras are open and fully interconnected via the central nervous system and adding to the super illuminal experience.
So the body is adding to the sensation that it can’t process but it knows that it is super illuminal thinking as the unentangled observer.
So it is keeping you grounded here but the consciousness can go beyond the speed of light to tens of millions of places and spaces simultaneously and collect millions of unique experiences in one millionth of a second and come back with it fully processed.
Then you go out and do it again and again until you’ve had your cup full.
Super illuminal thinking is more than we have learned,
read and studied.
It is knowingness growing to the next level without conscious cognition of it.
Everyone has experienced it,
you just didn’t know it and it is our level of practice that will determine how fast we can achieve this.

Q: How does the CELESTIAL MEDIUM interact with the PLANETARY MIND? A self-spawned celestial medium is a planet’s translator that is able to speak and communicate to other celestial minds and translates from that great higher frequency into a lower density energy so that everyone can understand the common messages.
The 7TH dimensional seed planet as a celestial medium is a bit different.
Celestial mediums can exist on every planet,
wherever there is a celestial mind.
A lot of celestial mediums will spawn before a planet is passing on,
before the light goes out which has happened on other worlds.
In order to safe their own lifeforce the celestial mediums travel deeply into the future to an endpoint of its consciousness before the light of the planet,
stream of energy,
fades out completely.
Through this process they can find the front point of their earliest celestial mind,
absorb it to reseed their celestial mind on another planet.

Q: Is this a source recognition of itself? It is lower density beings becoming higher density beings and  part of the procreation of life.
Celestial minds have their own astral worlds.
They have their own life reviews,
as well as a variety of things that keep them from dying or a natural process where something that is spawn from their world,
celestially inspired,
might even be an aspect of the planet that is gone to that ancient future space to receive that energy so that it can continue its infinite experience.
As a celestial medium here on earth you work with signature frequency matches for your capacity to translate.
The success lies how grounded you are in the physical plane,
in the body,
that you are manifested in as well as your capacity to take in those energies,
decode the 1 million letter alphabet,
translate it and then pack the code back up and give it back to the celestial source.

   THE AWAKENING JOURNEY through DISCONNECTION & RECONNECTION TO SOURCE
Q: What was the initial plan for Earth? We are living on a 7th dimensional galactic seed planet and Earth can teleport itself through time and space to seed blank Akashic Record worlds with lifeforce to start recording their own Akash.
Over millions of years prime creators had peaceful agreements with the celestial sources until someone figured out how the Galactic system of commerce and exchange worked and started skimming off the top like the Galactic Mafia.
Once we start reconnecting to source we can then become the celestial mediums of peace and start using the womb chakras to create as per Earth’s original plan to seed new life and bring celestial minds into the planet to bond within the solar system.
That celestial mind will then extend spiritual contracts to a sun and the sun extend its contracts to the lifeforce crafted onto it connecting it to the Galactic Celestial Commerce Market.

Q: What is the bigger picture on the awakening journey? The awakening is a re-emergence of the awareness strand of Galactic Commerce through celestial minds using celestial mediums as the guides and guideposts of the many frequencies of time.
This will allow the Ocean of Awareness to go into the Sea of Consciousness and generate incarnations and reincarnations within a Solar System that determines the scale of their incarnation: A Solar System,
an energetic being or a physical being within a world to experience the strands of connectivity.
Celestial minds who will then operate within galactic time in a Solar System .
This will also include all the forgotten selves in the void space that may have been effected by time based wars.

Q: What went wrong and how do we get back on track? Earth was originally created for the unique experience to spawn new galaxies but instead was heavily manipulated into becoming a DNA farm by means of the time travel wars.
Source disconnection and reconnection became that greater journey because the DNA manipulators were using the earth womb chakras to abuse people’s DNA to create servitude to false gods.

The purpose and mission for us here now is to experience the infinite ways of soul dis- and reconnection.
Earth offers a vast variety of messages and concepts to learn SOUL DISCONNECTION.
The more we learn to disentangle from the system of domination and control and from past lives gone awry the more we can step into the understanding of what true SOUL CONNECTION is.
There are people on this earth that have been planning hundreds of lifetimes in advance to come here now to assist with this process.
I call that that the RESISTANCE OF FREE EARTH.
Their purpose here is to find the soul codes among all of our commonality of species,
and then complete them.
Once we have a complete soul code as a species,
domination and control can no longer keep us separate as soul families and ultimate soul connection.

Q: What does source disconnection mean? Source disconnection is the representation of the journey of learning self-illumination.
Understanding the universal laws and the role of consciousness within those universal laws of the hologram that will lead to self-illumination via the journey of self-healing,
self-mastery,
understanding and application of personal sovereignty.

Q: What does source connection mean and teach us? Source connection is all about learning how to simultaneously exist as a multidimensional,
multifunctional photonic being of light as the DNA Light body matrix of one.
Living simultaneously as a finite and infinite incarnate life form in this spacetime equation as well as at a greater level outside of time on the celestial medium journey.
Source connection can still happen without the awareness of the celestial medium journey.
Choosing the multidimensional approach to source connection will make it easier though to understand how we are connected to source.
Take the example of abuse at a young age.
How can one heal from it faster? By developing spiritual skills to have intense source connection on both sides of the pendulum,
becoming a wider frequency,
vibration and harmony being for drama and conflict resolution.
Oneness has no meaning if we don’t understand the disconnection journey first.

Q: What would constitute a simultaneous source disconnection and connection? The charge & polarity created through entanglement in the GLOBAL NARRATIVE is a typical example of that.
The Global Narrative is teaching us both at the same time through the false science,
physics,
belief systems.
False light,
as a technology commonly used here,
is generally representing the source disconnection.
An example of source disconnection and connection would be false Gods.
Why would a highly aware species create false gods for life forms at a much lower level of awareness to them? For extended servitude in a hierarchical order to serve as a commodity farm.
Farming was implemented to harvest the infinite source energy.
The DNA farming technology allowed them to tap into the fundamental source of the exchange system.
It is manipulating the GALACTIC COMMERCE & EXCHANGE SYSTEM.
The Global Narrative simulates the Galactic Commerce Market and dumbs it down to its limited level in which we are made believe that we are just centric to this planet.
The false gods where the first idols of awareness used to begin to minimise our experience to those micro levels of existence.
The initial gods and further down the line religions became a major factor of limitation and implementation of hierarchical order.
Our narrative offers us a very limited and distorted picture on what is actually available to us as our birth right and legacy; an upside down,
inside out worldview and nowhere near to what is truly possible.

Q: How can we disentangle from the Global Narrative? In order to disentangle from the Global Narrative we have to temporarily accept the 3rd Dimension as our infinite source connected space until such a time we realise that 4th dimension is just a bridge dimension into new strands of  more dimensional awareness.
The surface world is going through a densification of light as our Solar System is moving into another galactic groove with more light into the 8th colour of time.
Part of accepting the 3rd dimension means to get back to natural living,
back to simplicity,
being present in the body now,
using this time now to heal,
to nurture to nourish the incarnate life form.
Inviting joy,
bliss and pleasure back into your life which is part of the original purpose of coming here to Earth.
The grand enjoyment and creation of life,
the journey from finite to infinite with death as a simple marker point for the change of energy before entering  the infinite frequency again.
In order to fully engage in this experience and understand spirituality we have to take the mystical out of the mysticism which will then result in mystical and magical synchronicities.
Part of that is the great forgetting at birth.

Q: How easy is it to create karma in unawareness? Very easy.
Let’s us use an example of resolving a greater spiritual contract in this lifetime by contemplating to walk out of a disfunctional relationship.
The thought of it makes you feel elated.
Your precognitive workforce gives you a preview what could happen if you did choose the experience without having to actually do it yet.
It is possible to have a parallel set of experiences where two parallel simultaneous existing yous have a thesf catalyst choices.
The simultaneously existing *I am* chooses to walk out but you don’t or the other way round,
it makes no difference.
There is an infinite amount of reasons why parallel cross overs can happen.
Either way it brings the old karmic journey to zero balance and creates a new one.
Why? Because of the law of entanglement.
And also,
even if there wasn’t any charge & polarity it would still create new karma.

Q: So when are we ever going to get out of karma? The whole point of the great awakening is to no longer use karmic debt and the universal laws of karma as way to resolve it.
THE AWAKENING IS THE END OF KARMA AS UNIVERSAL LAW.
That’s why karmic entanglement is no longer to be used as universal law because consciousness has become so evolved in our part of the galaxy and universe.
The simplicity of karma can be easily abused with intentionality behind it,
that can lock beings into servitude without end.
The great awakening is going to get us out of it.
The new ways of karma that are created now have new ways of resolution which the old ways didn’t have.

Q: How is DNA connected to source? DNA,
as part of the founder’s technology,
is the connective tissue from The Ocean of Awareness and Sea of Consciousness in a manifested,
light based wisdom and intelligence and consciousness for any animated biological or non-biological entity.
DNA was part of the founder’s technology.
It was fundamental when this universe was being created as a unique form of experience compared to other universes.
There are many variations of DNA.
Non-biological DNA is standard solidified matter which can also have DNA based rungs and structures within its growth patterns with inherent intelligence.
Look at the crystal and mineral communities,
they don’t need to walk to have an experience.
Walking is a unique experience and all the creations that spring from it.

Q: When the DNA was introduced through the founders what was the common denominator? The DNA strand organisation or strands themselves create the weave of the DNA,
the encoding of the strands.
Every strand represents a different level and capacity of memories being stored which then enfold into an implicate order of greater awareness.
DNA can store frequencies of time.

Q: Is this how we remember past lives? It is not the only way,
there are other ways to remember past lives.
The organisation of your strands and the rungs that connect your strands will determine how much you can remember from past lives.
There are certain strands that block out all past lives,
negative strands of wisdom and awareness.
That is why many people within this awakening will move those negative strands and replace them with positive ones.
Once we go through the awakening new strands are being added to our capacity.

Q: How does the quantum experiment ‘SPOOKY ACTION AT A DISTANCE’ relate to the source connection and disconnection and can you give us an example?
This ENTANGLEMENT experiment describes a quantum state that is not entirely independent of other states,
whether or not the individual objects are spatially separated.
As a result,
measurements performed on one system seem to instantaneously influence the other system(s) entangled with it,
so that none of the entangled states can be considered to be isolated from one another.
Let’s look at the ‘spooky law’ through the disentanglement and entanglement of the incarnate life form to source.
There is the entanglement within the hologram of a planet,
that has a surface,
subsurface and astral timelines.
Separate from its surface timeline,
which is a harvestable farm,
source connection and disconnection becomes primarily a surface based experience.
That experience,
as a choice based process,
will promote the unlimited point of view,
as entangled and unentangled observer and experiencer of the universal and galactic sources,
even though you are still embodied on a planetary surface separate from the solar system’s awareness.
Earth is a unique place of mass DNA farming that can lead to mass awakening through individual choice and responsibility.
This is the teaching of what this awakening is all about.

Q: Let’s look at CONNECTIVE TISSUE to explore this entanglement experiment in more detail? The person creating an experiment is creating a construct and that construct has connective tissue in the unseen world that allows data transference from the unseen layers of one DNA frequency to another.
Certain people have windows in the unseen layers that allow information to bleed through,
through the 5 senses to create a limited form of awareness through the entangled connected tissues.
The 5 senses are used as a processing system,
creating the 6th sense which then generates the INTUITION and awareness of it.

Q: Are these connective tissues in the DNA? Yes,
all in the DNA.
Think of the scientist having  a spiritual contract to do that experiment,
planned in the foetus of the womb,
achieved through free will.
In a structure scientific experiment like the ‘Spooky action at the distance’ you have 6 secs to think about your answer it could be a pre-imposed cognition because it is an experiment that is being recorded,
re-observed by multiple people who are unentangled observers from the moment of the creation of the construct.
It will be shown to other scientific people who repeat the experiment too.
Therefore it is pre-imposed cognition through intuition.

Q: Is there a greater DNA entanglement in families? Our DNA is entangled through the foetus of the womb planning opening a multitude of potentials omnidirectionally.
There are plenty of people within a family that do not have a great connection to each other.
It is really about the spiritual contract of the experience through the scientific revelation and reasoning of its purpose.

Q: What about inventions that have been simultaneously published in different localities or not far apart? There is the DNA connective tissue entanglement but are those inventors with same ideas part of the soul sentient,
soul family? As mentioned earlier it all comes down to the foetus in the womb planning who is going to take a thought construct into direct manifestation? Who is there as an entangled or unentangled observer and who will eventually market it and when? Remember,
not all parallel histories are exactly the same.
There are many parallel histories in which Tesslar’s perception was a lot more prevalent than Bells.
Or wooden ships stayed a lot longer as there wasn’t the same level of metal refinery in the states or the rest of the world.
Or other parallel realities where the steel mills where prevalently in Germany.
There can be bleed throughs and then that person jumps to these timelines,
it won’t come up in this reality but they will still be in the same historical reference.

The other side of this is looking at entanglement through THOUGHT CONSTRUCTS.
A thought construct is when we are living with a person for a long time we generate a point of view about them.
That is a construct that makes very easy observation about someone because you have many neural pathways between the two of you,
which then creates additional pattern recognition and consequently more thoughts.
You then project the entire thought construct onto that person or not.
Healing & self mastery can reverse it.
This is also where the pre- and post cognitive workforce come in as your personal human resource department you have in yourself,
an unlimited amount of data to process into thought constructs and information to stay connected.

THE FEMALE CYCLE: AN EXAMPLE OF MANIPULATION &  ENTANGLEMENT THROUGH ‘SPOOKY DISTANCE’
Technically,
there is a 3rd eye in the heart too which is often activated through child birth.
Men have to create much more consciously than women who are going through that physiological change during pregnancy and childbirth assisting in the creation of that heart spaced 3rd eye.
It is fair to say that the menstruation cycle is a way for the rods and cones to align with the 3rd eye plus the ones in the heart,
rectum or clitoris,
all extensions of the 3rd eye.
A man’s 3rd eye can travel to the tip of the penis and connect into the womb portal from there.
Menstrual cramps & pains are often a sign of being out of alignment in those areas.
A most beneficial prayer technique for women during their cycle is to call in all their thoughts,
ideas,
constructs,
energies from previous menstruation cycles and detach from them on a month to month basis.
These powerful times for women are being high jacked and bastardised by the Global Narrative.
The menstrual blood is very powerful as an energy of being a negotiator,
an arbitrator,
a  conciliar,
a diplomat,
a pacifier,
a placator,
peacemaker,
an appeaser ….
.

FROM EARTHLY to UNIVERSAL PRO-CREATION IN THE FEMALE CYCLE
Q: What happens during menopause? ‘Meno’ meaning less as well as ‘pause’ indicating interrupted,
suspended action can be a misleading usage of words when we realise what is really going on.
The woman still goes through her cycles without blood manifestation.
The fertility spirits that are attached to it have moved on to a higher density.
The DNA is no longer producing the unique experience of bleeding but the spiritual mechanics remain the same and are even more intensified through menopause.
In most women’s cases,
when they are experiencing heavy menopausal symptoms,
they are actually giving birth in other simultaneous realities where lower amounts of births are prevalent.
Their remaining fertile life force is going to alter versions of themselves who for some reason didn’t get pregnant.
Using their biological clock they can find a signature frequency match to complete interdimensional birthing as part of their karmic resolution.

Q: What are HOT FLUSHES? Hot flushes can happen when an alternate version of you is going through the breaking of the birth water and is more than likely going to die from the birth.
You are transferring chemical lifeforce based on your experience to avoid this.
A hot flush can also be another version of you in another place and time in an alien form,
in which the birth got difficult.
Remember,
birthing is part of karmic resolution.
Through the strands of awareness in your DNA,
the connective tissues transfer energy,
lifeforce to assist in that birth by another simultaneous version of yourself who lacks fertility power or lives in an environment with no fertility at all.
That allows the mystical births to happen for the baby that should have never survived or lived.
Evening Primrose Oil is one of the natural remedies to reduce hot flashes.
This plant oil is being harvested as an essence to lessen the effect in this reality and at the same time it is amplifying the experience on the unseen side.

Q: Can you talk about the changes in estrogen and progesterone during menopause? Here we are looking at the manipulation of the body’s chemicals that will determine if DNA is going to be activated or not.
Some strands in the DNA need a special chemical soup in the body to activate fertility.
It used to be manipulated in the overall chemistry of the body so other strands have more opportunities to awaken instead of that particular fertility strand.
What happens to a woman who never gave earthly birth and is going through a very difficult time during menopause? Another version of her simultaneous existence will go through a birthing experience and they both will be intrinsically linked in order to reduce the overall negative effect.
There are other experiences where many simultaneous existing souls going through menopause to assist the galaxies or universe to generate new life in the celestial nurseries and give birth to a brandnew soul frequency to be brought into the Ocean of Awareness.
From there that soul frequency can begin the journey into the Sea of Consciousness and manifest in time and space.

Q: What about the fatty deposits around the midline during menopause?  This serves as a protective membrane but it can at times be a blockade to good experiences too with regards to working with a woman’s residual image.
Once the biological fertility clock stops ticking the ‘awareness clock’ takes over where you can gain a greater awareness and perspective of the awakening.
Your legacy to the future,
be it applied to your local family or to a bigger bubble of reality.
This journey to greater levels of awareness can trigger great psychic skills as much as great depression depending on the mental acuity and the particular coping skills each individual has.

Q: What about the mood swings ? You can experience mood swings when the body is trying to find the right chemistry,
a balance between over and underproducing hormones and chemicals.
Keep in mind though that an imbalance here in this lifetime is balancing somewhere else when taking the ancestral perspective into account.

Q: What about men? Men go through menopause too and they also have their individual process through cycles of creation.
As they actualise their physical manifestations,
a house,
artwork,
business they leave their legacy for their clan,
their tribe and nation.
Men build an archive of experiences that can stay manifested through space and time in which lineages in the unseen can start planning lives through the infrastructure created through that urge of manifestation.
Men meet their sexual peak energies around the age 18 whereas women reach their peak in their 30s.
This is why it is important for that infrastructure in the unseen to be planned for.
That has also been manipulated by DNA Farming.
Once again if natural birthing weren’t manipulated the way it is most pregnancies would be a 18 to 24 months.
In some instances,
depending on the soul it can be up to five years.
The umbilical cord wouldn’t be cut off sometimes for months.
This would allow bigger bonding between the partners and have more opportunity for the father to have ritual connection to the child with the mother as the medium of that connection.

Q: Is Testosterone driving the creativity in men? Yes and there are other parts similar to testosterone that drive other constructing factors.
Like a scientist doesn’t use testosterone,
he uses another version of it,
more like a mental aspect versus I need a sledgehammer to create.
There is no scientific name for that yet in this reality.
There are several hundred forms of testosterone,
each with a different chemical chain that allows a different nature of creation.
Through ways of manipulation of our incarnate life form we are not producing the all encompassing testosterone which keeps us in fight,
flight and freeze.
The glands have been manipulated to produce one strand of testosterone over the other which leads us back to the cerebellum in the motor cortex.

Q: What about the manipulation through birth control pill and the water contamination through it? Do you know what modern birth control pill is? Giant farms of female horses that are forever pregnant and they harvest the urine which is being used as birth control.
The pill is basically based off a slave pregnancy regime.
A horse doesn’t have a choice to get pregnant or not.
They are literally pregnant for their entire life and then has its offerings taken and chopped up into horse meat and the urine for pills.
That’s why so many women reject the different types of pills and it becomes detrimental to their wellbeing.
Before there was the horse urine based pill there were plenty of natural herbal remedies to stop pregnancy.
They stopped using them to pattern a pill and start charging for them.

	CONSCIOUSNESS ENTANGLEMENT through the incarnate life form outside of time-space Equation
1.
	REINCARNATION / DNA / LIFE REVIEW / NEAR DEATH EXPERIENCES
Q: What is the reincarnation process from a DNA perspective? DNA is 80 percent memoires.
That's one of the first fundamental understandings science and spirituality are going to have to come to terms with.
We live in a reality of photonic light that has a bunch of rules in it that says how photonic light beings incarnate,
express and exchange,
and when they pass on,
how they express and exchange in another scale.
And the DNA is the encoding or the soul,
or the light body is the cypher that uncodes and unpacks the experience.

And as we come back,
and many times over,
to the same type of living,
after a while we store memories in DNA lineages,
and this is how we go to the immortality aspect,
where we keep getting born into a lineage that has our own memories in it,
and has our regular soul family incarnation process in it,
so we can become bigger and greater beings of divinity and light.
We also live in a time where they do not teach of our DNA lineage.
They teach of mathematics and DNA and RNA and how it can be easily changed and altered.
Well,
that is true because DNA is still light in another form.
It is visible on one spectrum and invisible on another spectrum.
When our consciousness reaches the peak of where we are right now in our cells there's a part of our super consciousness that's working with this reality,
constantly encoding every micro second of fraud time into light into our memory.
Memory is not physical.
Memory,
is it tangible? Is it electronic? It is a form of light that has to be stored into an experience.
​​​​​​​We,
as streams of consciousness have thousands of sub carrier codes of millions of different experiences inside us.
And all we have to do is tune into that memory and we can go into that stream of experience at any scale we desire using a variety of tools.

Q: What is the other 20 percent of the DNA referring to? Our forms are programmed to harmony – that other 20% of our DNA that is not necessarily entangled with Consciousness.
Around 7% is made up of harmony,
frequency,
vibration and the remaining 13% corresponds to how the spiritual codes and contracts unfold in linear and none-linear time.
What agencies you work or don’t work with as well as how no-time beings can consciously entangle with the time based you to create a brand new contract that is need for change,
auditing of the self.


Q: Is this also the part of the DNA that refers to the Precognitive Workforce? Yes,
and there is a precognitive and postcognitive workforce also.
The PRECOGS are aligning the infinite set of choices,
the plan A,
B,
C… the choices for this particular moment.
POSTCOGNITIVE WORKFORCE is fixing some of the perception mistakes so that there is a clear line of understanding that there is a past,
present and future and the evolution of thought into constructism itself.
All that is happening based on the choices that we are making here in time.
There are choices that we make that are outside of time too as celestial mediums and at whatever higher state of awareness we choose to emanate at that moment,
yes

Q: What is a Near Death Experience (NDE)? A near death experience would be part of spiritual contract to allow you to see who,
what,
where you have been this life time since you took your first breath aided by your mother’s placenta in her womb.
It can be an account of your past and future lives intersecting,
losing or gaining potentials on the journey of your soul.
People often meet their guides and guardians and others they have met during their lifespan.
In order for it to be considered a near death experience the body has to still go through the trauma of it.
It is when the aura somewhat pops in a metaphorical sense and the initially contained life force start excuding the body.
After that pop there is this vacuum of energy where the body must produce more chi and maintain it to stay alive.
The last breaths are using up the body’s last alchemical fuel from birth.
In the NDE the brain loses the interconnectivity with the organs whilst the organs still remain a part of the hologram.
The *I am*ness begins to disintegrate its technological structure and you go back to the Ocean of Awareness where you may have lasting attachments to who you have been in previous lifetimes.
This can trigger life reviews and direct healings of the body connecting you back into the original blue print of health.
Some people have visions of all different places and spaces of potentialities to refill the soul’s capacity.
Going through this transcendence phase it is vital to maintain that auric bubble around themselves to not drain out their life force energy  There are times when you come back from a NDE as an educated illuminated being meaning the other side taught you something very specific.
It is a change in spiritual contracts,
with a new set of DNA based coded purposes.
This is not necessarily a walk in experience as walk ins are extremely rare and often get misidentified with NDEs.


Q: Is it true to say that we are leaving time & space when going through a NDE? Yes,
with a NDE you are leaving the timespace equation as you are moving into the Ocean of Awareness and then from there you come back.
Once you lose connection to the organs and it is just the vagus nerve and the spinal column reporting data the body has gone through enough shut down to facilitate that.
What essentially happens is that you are disconnected from the hologram because you are not supported by the aura anymore.
You can’t maintain that internal energy flow,
it just keeps flowing out of the body.
Once we lost that bubble around us we are no longer in the shared reality rules and begin to waver between many different worlds including the Ocean of Awareness,
as our ancestral connection.
The Sea of Consciousness is more for the many dreaming beings travelling back and forth,
contracted with you on linear and non-linear scales,
so that you stay invested in an era of light and don’t check out before your time.

As you are leaving time and space,
depending on what kind of NDE you have,
you can go to a very high density and dimensional realm.
This is when the foetus in the womb had a grand goal that you had not achieved yet and you can be sent to 7th  or 8th density to experience life from there and then return with some of those potent memories intact.
Often people are so overwhelmed by the experience and think they can’t live up to that energy being that they perceived themselves as.
And the message is that you can as it is already who you are and the NDE has assisted you to discover that.
Those experiences would be contracted out beforehand in the foetus in the womb planning.

Bystanders can sometimes accompany that soul through the experience of meeting loved ones on the other side be that now in NDE or death scenario.
Life reviews can be seen as random moments,
even though everything has an underlying universal order.
When one has a life review as part of their NDE it was to close the spiritual contracts and grow beyond them because the soul in the internal and external infrastructure hasn’t been able to resolve those issues.
It also helps the understanding of the existential structure of how the foetus in the womb plans all sets of experiences including traumas,
dramas,
karmas,
dharmas.
Often when doctors,
nurses or family members perceive light leaving the body that can be the chi,
the lifeforce leaving the body at the end of the transition process.
It all depends on how the life & death experience has been orchestrated in the foetus planning.
It does happen that people have magical unique deaths as another way of assisting their loved ones to mend broken faith,
accept the mystical in front of them and ease them into the griefing process.

Q: What is the difference between a NDE to an Outer Body Experience (OBE)? OBEs are generally astral travel which is very different to  NDE.
The astral body still has the auric bubble intact and keeps storing chi within the hologram.

Q: How come people can literally feel pain and think thoughts when going through a NDE? In a life review you have lost enough of your *I am* to perceive incidents from all different angles,
sides and different points of view at the same time.
So yes,
you may experience the pain you have inflicted onto others as if being in their bodies as well as feel the sensations of others during interactions with you.
You may also find yourself having an array of thoughts as many NDE’s report.
Remember,
thoughts have an electro chemical frequency that use the body’s base electro magnetic frequency as a storage system.
This is how it creates a linear time stamp.
Through those near death experiences the body releases those energies hence they come into the forefront of your awareness.
As an infinite being in the Ocean of Awareness you can still experience those feeling as part of the transition process.
The physical reactions can help people to acknowledge and give meaning and resolution to their experience once they return from a NDE.
As the body takes the last breaths there is a chemical reaction going on for as much as seven days afterwards,
still a form of attachment,
a process of letting go of the frequency of thoughts and feelings.
In many mourning rituals you stay with the dead body to honour and witness the letting go journey of all the karmas and dharmas as an alchemical form of resolution for the deceased as well as the family members.

Q: Can you say more on the life review outside of NDE?  The life review is part of the transition process and cannot be by passed,
we all have to do it.
When you are on the verge of death you don’t necessarily remember what to do and that is absolutely fine and normal.
There are people that understand the death as part of the ongoing journey and have prepared for it and then there are those who are in fear and panic.
Either way your state of mind at the time will be open to have your guides and guardians assist you to begin the life review.
Images of life long avoidance and the preciousness of life are being recognised through the dwindling of consciousness.
We can learn to value death as a new beginning,
a change of energy and consciousness,
instead of being afraid of it.
Can you allow that to be a part of your ongoing daily practice? Death is just a different level of awareness.
Your choices in this lifetime now will determine how much ease you will have with your life review.
The life you are participating now is precious and pregnant with possibilities to be experienced to the fullest.
The understanding of death can expand one’s consciousness and take away the fear.
At the end of the day death is an acceptance journey to ensure that you have lived your life without regrets,
without forcefully jeopardising your joy,
health and wellbeing The rest is instant gratification of uneducated mind that is in fear.

Q: Can bodies be trapped in false light? The process of capturing a soul right after it has left the body is technically a possibility but very unlikely to be practiced.
It requires a lot of energy and a developped infrastructure in place to put the soul essence into a simulated environment where it may have ancestors and then force it right back into the body with a limited or partial life review.
That is known as the false light technology.

Just like with ghost scenarios,
when going through life reviews one doesn’t necessarily have all the higher levels of awareness available.
A lot of times when the life review starts the soul is shattered into thousands of different shards and it is the oversoul that comes in and patches them back together.
It takes out the negative soul shards,
puts them into a secondary file where another foetus from another womb may use those soul shards from another life,
a past life and integrate it into the infinite foetus blueprint choice so that shard can get resolution in another lifetime.
Remember soul shards are not *I am*s.
There is help from the oversoul to have a greater experience through creating liftetime after lifetime.
We have access to the oversoul right now,
just a thought away,
will you believe it,
will you trust it?
Q: Can we become stuck in the reincarnation cycle? No,
we are not stuck in reincarnation.
We are incarnating and reincarnating and the first part of your life you maybe a reincarnating soul and if you break through the false propaganda you may be an incarnating soul.
Or you start as an incarnating soul,
run into a bunch of badass people that make you into a reincarnating soul,
repeating their karmas.
You can be both at the same time depending on the issues in the ancestral lineage of your family.

	THE JOURNEY TO CELESTIAL MEDIUMSHIP OF PEACE
Q: What is the CELESTIAL MEDIUM OF PEACE? When you have elevated yourself and you go through the journey of transferring the consciousness of your allness to become the celestial medium of peace.
It is operating in the physical,
the red and blue road as well as on the celestial road and its many brothers and sisters.

Q: What are celestial minds? We learn this through astrology,
how astrology and the different worlds can affect us.
We are working with celestial minds who are incarnating here in our world,
other worlds,
physical,
non-physical,
entangled and unentangled observers.
We begin to work collectively with them at the celestial medium level.
What needs to be resolved through peace at the minds of how the planets work.

Q: Is becoming a celestial medium of peace our birthright? Yes,
there is a linear process to it before it becomes fully non-linear.
The linear process is self-mastery,
understanding the length of your waveform,
how strong and potent you are so when you go through the conscious aware choice to become that celestial medium between the celestial minds and the surface minds for the generation of subject matters of peace.
You learn how to bring unique concepts of peace to places and space of time that are looking for that medium to inspire new layers of peace.

Q: As more people come into celestial mediumship how does that effect the global narrative? The global narrative will become more irrelevant to the greater growth of humanity.
Humanity will start realising that the global narrative is irrelevant to the bigger streams of time,
it has no staying power.
We will be detoxifying from roman numeral time and could probably enter a system of commerce beyond the Babylonian money course.
There are celestial commerce exchange systems that can allow matter to matter manifestations from one density to another.

Q: Will we all become celestial mediums of peace? No,
the celestial medium of peace purpose is a very narrow band in the general awakening.
The selfspawns had the contract to do it 20 or 40 years ahead of time so that it was seeded in the 3-5 previous generations so there is colloquial now presentation of the very concept.
You’ve got to create concepts and language that have a staying power so that there are general jumps creating the various bubbles of reality and the different levels of awareness and consciousness.
It prepares you ahead of time for when you then in the flow and it is not about any of the common topics of the global narrative distracting from a greater growth,
then celestial medium of peace will be there for anyone to connect with our planet.
Before you leave her world to become a a part of the greater group out there she’s got some stuff to tell you.
Just like covid is our story,
it’s a story we might relate to some Pleiadians around a fire.

   THE UNVANQUISHED DREAM OF PEACE
Q: What is meant with the APPARATUS OF INFINITE INTERCONNECTIVITY – THE HUB OF INTERCONNECTIVITY? The apparatus of infinite interconnectivity is the many simultaneous existing selves who create the network between themselves that form the hub of interconnectivity.
It is also part of your pre- and post cognitive workforce.
The UNVANQUISHED DREAM is an aspect of the apparatus which then gives you even greater connection to all the versions of yourself who are sharing that perspective.
THE UNVANQUISHED DREAMER OF PEACE comes in here too.
Its purpose is to connect to and interconnect to all the forgotten and remembered oceans of awareness and many seas of consciousness that are in the multiverse which is layered on top of all the forms of thought and awareness and to connect them in a single time-space location in which they can manifest the wordsmith creation.

Q: Can you go into the mechanics of our precognitive workforce,
how it works and how we can best use them to help us on the great journey to dream the great dream of peace? Our precognitive workforce is us that has the capacity to understand that we can create an infinite amount of conscious time travel versions of ourselves.
They can go into the future,
into the past and prepare a resource of knowledge and information that’s instantly called on as masterful manifestations of inspiration in the moment to out create anything that is a negative,
dampening,
sucking,
draining,
frequency within the system of domination and control.
Your *I am* precognitive workforce is all of your other versions of self that are simultaneously existing that have earned,
learned and relearned the rights of awareness.
That means that if you are choosing to be a spiritually aware being,
existing in all time-space equations and that you are contemplating all aspects of it.
There are frequencies out there that are not all positive.
You as this *I am* here now being make this declaration in your frequency that you are a being of equal cocreation,
non-competition,
non-hierarchical dreaming *I am* breakaway DNA light body civilisation of one who is here in this DNA form this lifetime.
You are now using the genuine work to make a great impact on those that you love,
your family,
your clan,
your nation,
your tribe and earth mother.
If you are choosing to do that on all scales you need a masterful precognitive workforce which is your birth right and legacy to create as a natural co-creative evolutionary being who is a part of the great dreamtime awakening.
You are using your responsibility to impact on the loves of your life,
the themes and ideologies that you are wishing to promote to others so that they can find their own self illumination and belief free from external gurus without sending them down the paths to false illumination.
Our precognitive workforce is there waiting to work with us,
to think with us,
to love with us,
to be part of our greater expression.
We must put the time,
effort,
energy into believing that we can call upon our inner geniuses from many dimensions,
timestreams,
galaxies and universes to form a forceful collective of all of us who are all part of this dreamtime awakening so we can free ourselves from the perception of limitation by the global narrative.

Q: Have shamans always used their precognitive workforce? Yes,
they just used them in their era of light or their theme of times.
Every generation learns from the previous one and the generation that follows interprets the next and then there are the rebel few who get back to the source of creation and look at that as their only interpretation.
That is where we understand we are all of our past,
present and future selves simultaneously existing.
You are a signature frequency match to your precognitive workforce and to the collective workforce of the highest forms of your light soul teachers,
all of the *I am*s that are a part of your great hall of Akashic Records.

Q: Would you be treading on someone’s journey if you sent out your precognitive workforce to help them in a co-creational way?  There’s always a fine line where too much is too much.
If the other being has no precognition or any form of understanding of what a precognitive workforce is then you will be stepping on their journey unless it is an infant or a young child who hasn’t formed an *I am* yet.
Most children don’t fully form the *I am* until puberty when their thymus gland creates 300 new forms of chemicals that suddenly floods the body to create puberty itself which solidifies the *I am* technology as a time-space equation.

Q: So where would they send out their precognitive workforce from,
what would be their source if they’re not *I am* aware? So first you would have a conversation with them where you are going to cojoin your precognitive workforces to create a manifestation of synchronicities that helps each of the beings cocreate an aspect that brings some form of inner inspiration and healing.
This is why healers become facilitators so that they can amalgamate their precognitive workforce with the natural precognitive workforce of the ill person who may not have any consciousness skills.
If those *I am* beings want to become true consciousness beings of choice they must learn the process of self-illumination.
There’s an infinite amount of teachers out there in the great dreamtime awakening .
Discover what’s the signature frequency match for you then go out,
evolve and create.
