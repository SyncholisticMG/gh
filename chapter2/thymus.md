##   Thymus

The thymus generates the temporal experience in the body-mind-spirit as a complex unit.
It's called the high heart because it serves as the doorway to our higher spirit to come into the DNA experience.
In science the thymus is called a one and done gland.

The thymus encapsulates the heart through the pericardium,
which is where it is originally created.
When the heart starts to grow from its original multi-cellular structure,
it is the thymus that creates the temporal awareness,
and it remains there,
assisting the magnetic flux of the heart to harmonize with time.
Inside the thymus are neural pathways that allow the transformation,
transmutation,
and transfiguration of multiple forms of time between the heart and the brain,
the heart and the gut and then the heart-brain-gut as a unified structure.
The thymus and the lymph system contain those special neural pathways separate of the entire central nervous system and separate of the vagus nerve.
It's like its own Morse Code.
