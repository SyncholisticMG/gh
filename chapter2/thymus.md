##   Thymus

The thymus generates the temporal experience in the body-mind-spirit as a complex unit.
It's called the high heart because it serves as the doorway to our higher spirit to come into the DNA experience.
In science the thymus is called a one and done gland.

The thymus encapsulates the heart through the pericardium,
which is where it is originally created.
When the heart starts to grow from its original multi-cellular structure,
it is the thymus that creates the temporal awareness,
and it remains there,
assisting the magnetic flux of the heart to harmonize with time.
Inside the thymus are neural pathways that allow the transformation,
transmutation,
and transfiguration of multiple forms of time between the heart and the brain,
the heart and the gut and then the heart-brain-gut as a unified structure.
The thymus and the lymph system contain those special neural pathways separate of the entire central nervous system and separate of the vagus nerve.
It's like its own Morse Code.



The Thymus is used,
not the vagus nerve,
because this is time itself,
gut-time versus heart-time versus brain-time versus unified gut-brain-heart time.
Imagine a multiple choice test
&mdash;
fifty questions in an hour,
sixty-two seconds per question.
This is the brain's calculation of time.
The heart measures the one hour as the potential of the experience.
The gut deploys intuition strategically into the perfectly understood time span.
This is the magic and mystery of gut-time.
It's been a part of our colloquial forever
&mdash;
gut feeling.


A third of all our central nervous pathways are in our gut,
a third in our heart,
and a third in our brain.
It almost forms a kind of check and balance system,
not dissimilar to the executive,
legislative,
and judicial triumvirate of power in the United States.
When they work together you have *temporal awareness*
&mdash;
three perspectives unified.


The body-mind-spirit as a being has many forms of awareness.
The brain,
heart,
and gut are the triumvirate of temporal awareness.
We receive time and space and begin our map.
Time creates space.
Space requires cartography.
Cartography is the true mother of all art and science.
Without measurement we would not have been able to build.
In one clear aspect,
all scriptures,
both east and west,
may be seen as inner cartography,
the landscape of the imagination.


A very unknown American poet,
despite having won the Nobel Prize for Poetry in 1955,
Wallace Stevens,
whose poetry itself was very much an examination of the imagination as a human utility and as a universal expression of nature and God,
penned it beautifully in his poem,
*Another Weeping Woman*.



>Pour the unhappiness out
>From your too bitter heart,
>Which grieving will not sweeten.
>
>Poison grows in this dark.
>It is in the water of tears
>Its black blooms rise.

>The magnificent cause of being,
>The imagination, the one reality
>In this imagined world

>Leaves you
>With him for whom no phantasy moves,
>And you are pierced by a death.




The gut,
heart,
and brain possess deep awareness of the energies around us.
Electromagnetic frequencies are impacted by their environment.
The Schumann resonance is the unheard electromagnetic frequency effected by solar winds.
radiation,
and planetary magnetics.
This is how the universal mind communicates to us and generates time in the temporal awareness.
It represents an opportunity for consciousness expansion.
