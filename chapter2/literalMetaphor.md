## The Literal Metaphor

Observation is also implicate order awareness.
The observer effect should not have come so early in the crystallization process.
Some people can have a three sense observation and still access the ocean of awareness
&mdash;
another bloodline influence example.
Free will is tainted by the bloodline.
We grow additional strands of awareness.
The ocean of awareness and the sea of consciousness crystallizes and changes the bloodline at a certain level of acceptance and integration.
This is the journey of the celestial medium
&mdash;
*I transfer the allness of myself to become the celestial medium.
I no longer need to grow in this narrative.
The next narrative I grow is in the spiritual commerce network.*

We are hypothetical beings.
We can believe in many things.
The universe determines what manifests through our wills.
Hypothetical becomes *I am*.
It's realized through engaging our belief engines which allow strands of awareness to influence intuition
&mdash;
precognition and postcognition
&mdash;
without competition or hierarchy.
A multidimensional being manifests into this third dimension through created tangible experiences co-created with the infinite celestial medium.
The incarnate life form is the expression of the present,
the here,
the now.

Epigenetic urges influenced by past memories often keep us from creating new experiences.
We have lived billions of incarnations.
It's vital we disconnect from them and reconnect with source.
This is the way to create new memories,
which is part of the awakening journey.
We sometimes over-identify with aspects of our evolution.
Identity as myth is rarely explored,
but it can hugely influence the way we experience life,
and how we create in it.
The more we identify with one part of our journey
&mdash;
grand earthly masters of manifestation or spiritual celestial mediums
&mdash;
the more we limit ourselves and inhibit our access to the possibilities of the many divine holograms.
Buckminster Fuller immortalized the phrase
&mdash;
*I seem to be a verb*
&mdash;
when it came to considering identity.

```
I live on Earth at present,
and I don’t know what I am.
I know that I am not a category.
I am not a thing — a noun.
I seem to be a verb,
an evolutionary process — an integral function of the universe.
```

Identity is a strange thing.
Thought is not static,
It's a process of movement.
Different metaphors in our belief engines change the very nature of the internal representation.
By looking at celestial mediumship from this different perspective,
we can change the way we identify with it,
gain clarity and ease on how we interact and work with it.
Ask
&mdash;
*what does celestial mediumship look like for me*
&mdash;
a ship that helps us sail through the ocean of awareness and the sea of consciousness,
a vehicle we sit behind,
a building we construct?
It's all about the unique way we internalize the subject matter to fractalize the strands of information,
enter it to cognition,
and realize it in the here and now.
Talk in pictures.
Metaphor may be alchemically  internalized as an expression of a multidimensional,
multifunctional being of photonic light.
