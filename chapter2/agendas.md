## Agendas

There's a specific fetus agenda lifetime to lifetime.
The *avatar* agenda evolves the greater soulâ€™s ability to generate light and have experiences over thousands and thousands of *I am* expressions who have been fetuses.
There are times where the over-soul
&mdash;
the avatar
&mdash;
gets looped in servitude to a system which lowers its capacity to use light,
and,
as a result,
it cannot expand.

A non-agenda being occurs when time is irrelevant to the great experience.
Linear time is not the focus of the agenda.
It may do one thing twenty-eight thousand years ago,
seventeen things two years ago,
two million things forty-eight million years ago,
and that,
technically speaking,
is a non-agenda.
The things done in the non-agenda create a resolution for some agendas or apply potential solutions for agendas stuck and unable to move forward.
Non-agenda allows us to cut and paste time-based experiences out of certain *I am* experiences and use them temporarily in a new *I am* expression to manifest past or future non-agenda aspects into a present agenda.
