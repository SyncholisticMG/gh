## Mineral Consciousness


Crystals and rocks are communities of beings that are part of the sea of consciousness,
too.
Crystals are part of the implicate and explicate order,
simultaneously entangled and unentangled.
We can imprint entangled narrative perceptions and agendas upon crystals with our precognitive workforce.
A crystal will do what it needs to do for us based off how our precognitive workforce manifests the matter.
They are part of the ocean of awareness that becomes part of the sea of consciousness as animated matter.
Crystal allows us access to the ocean of awareness and the sea of consciousness based on our capacity to perceive,
receive,
process,
and manifest it.
The crystalline structure is materialized,
no longer a fluid ocean of awareness or sea of consciousness.
When we enter the sixth and seventh dimensions,
crystallization is the lower end technology for generating matter based awareness.
