## Precognitive Sharing

Our precognitive workforce is us.
It is the understanding we can create infinite conscious versions of ourselves and travel time,
future and past,
and prepare a resource of knowledge and information we can instantly call upon as manifestations of inspiration to beat anything negative.
Our *I am* precognitive workforce is composed of simultaneously existing versions of ourselves.
These others have earned the right for cross-time collaboration.
There are negative frequencies in this journey.
We need to empower ourselves.
The *I am* in the here and now declares itself a being of co-creation,
absent competition and hierarchy,
a dreaming *I am* breakaway DNA light body civilization of one in this life form,
the human being.
We can use the genuine work to make a great impact on loved ones,
family,
clan,
nation,
tribe,
and earth mother.
If we choose to do this on all scales,
we need a masterful precognitive workforce,
our birth right and legacy,
to create as a natural co-creative evolutionary being who is part of the great dreamtime awakening.
We use our responsibility to impact on the loves of our lives,
the themes and ideologies we promote to others,
a little dreamtime capital so they can find their own illumination,
free from gurus,
without sending them down paths to false illumination.
Our precognitive workforce is there waiting to work with us,
to think with us,
to love with us,
to be part of our greater expression.
We must put the time,
effort,
and energy into understanding we can call upon our inner geniuses from many dimensions,
time streams,
galaxies,
and universes to form a forceful collective,
all of us,
all part of this dreamtime awakening,
freeing ourselves from the limitation of the global narrative.

Shamans have always used their precognitive workforce.
Every generation learns from the previous.
We are a signature frequency match to our precognitive workforce,
and to the collective workforce of the highest forms of our light soul teachers,
all of the *I am* instances as part of our great hall of akashic records.

We tread on someone else’s journey if we send out our precognitive workforce to help them in a co-creational way.
There’s a fine line where too much is too much.
If the other being has no precognition,
or any form of understanding of what a precognitive workforce is,
we are stepping on their journey.
Infants or young children who haven't formed an *I am* yet are okay.
Most children don’t fully form the *I am* until puberty,
when the thymus gland creates three hundred new chemicals that suddenly flood the body.
This is puberty itself.
It solidifies the *I am* technology as a time-space equation.
When we assist others with our precognitive workforce,
we have an interdimensional conversation with them whereby we join our precognitive workforces to create a manifestation of synchronicities.
It helps each of the parties co-create an event which brings inspiration and healing.
Healers become facilitators.
They amalgamate their precognitive workforce with the precognitive workforce of the ill person.
The ill person may not have any consciousness skills.
If those *I am* beings want to become true consciousness beings of choice they must learn the process of self-illumination.
There’s an infinite amount of teachers out there in the great dreamtime awakening. .
Discover what’s the signature frequency match for you then go out,
evolve,
and create.
