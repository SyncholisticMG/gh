## Precognitive Sharing

Our precognitive workforce is us.
It is the understanding we can create infinite conscious versions of ourselves and travel time,
future and past,
and prepare a resource of knowledge and information we can instantly call upon as manifestations of inspiration to beat anything negative.
Our *I am* precognitive workforce is composed of simultaneously existing versions of ourselves.
These others have earned the right for cross-time collaboration.
There are negative frequencies in this journey.
We need to empower ourselves.
The *I am* in the here and now declares itself a being of co-creation,
absent competition and hierarchy,
a dreaming *I am* breakaway DNA light body civilization of one in this life form,
the human being.
We can use the genuine work to make a great impact on loved ones,
family,
clan,
nation,
tribe,
and earth mother.
If we choose to do this on all scales,
we need a masterful precognitive workforce,
our birth right and legacy,
to create as a natural co-creative evolutionary being who is part of the great dreamtime awakening.
We use our responsibility to impact on the loves of our lives,
the themes and ideologies we promote to others,
a little dreamtime capital so they can find their own illumination,
free from gurus,
without sending them down paths to false illumination.
Our precognitive workforce is there waiting to work with us,
to think with us,
to love with us,
to be part of our greater expression.
We must put the time,
effort,
and energy into understanding we can call upon our inner geniuses from many dimensions,
time streams,
galaxies,
and universes to form a forceful collective,
all of us,
all part of this dreamtime awakening,
freeing ourselves from the limitation of the global narrative.

Shamans have always used their precognitive workforce.
Every generation learns from the previous.
We are a signature frequency match to our precognitive workforce,
and to the collective workforce of the highest forms of our light soul teachers,
all of the *I am* instances as part of our great hall of akashic records.

We tread on someone else’s journey if we send out our precognitive workforce to help them in a co-creational way.
There’s a fine line where too much is too much.
If the other being has no precognition,
or any form of understanding of what a precognitive workforce is,
we are stepping on their journey.
Infants or young children who haven't formed an *I am* yet are okay.
Most children don’t fully form the *I am* until puberty,
when the thymus gland creates three hundred new chemicals that suddenly flood the body.
This is puberty itself.
It solidifies the *I am* technology as a time-space equation.
When we assist others with our precognitive workforce,
we have an interdimensional conversation with them whereby we join our precognitive workforces to create a manifestation of synchronicities.
It helps each of the parties co-create an event which brings inspiration and healing.
Healers become facilitators.
They amalgamate their precognitive workforce with the precognitive workforce of the ill person.
The ill person may not have any consciousness skills.
If those *I am* beings want to become true consciousness beings of choice they must learn the process of self-illumination.
There’s an infinite amount of teachers out there in the great dreamtime awakening. .
Discover what’s the signature frequency match for you then go out,
evolve,
and create.

Our temporal awareness been manipulated.
A lot of weaponized time travel technology interferes with humanity’s capacity to perceive time.
We can be heavily confused with our temporal awareness.
Confusion is an aspect of temporal distortion.
It can be sped up or slowed down.
Our temporal awareness is unconscious to time speeding up or slowing down.
Our individual temporal awareness determines our perception and perspective on how fast the algorithm can move.
Separate from the vagus nerve,
the thymus generates temporal awareness between the brain,
heart,
and gut,
then all three separate from unity,
making it easier to split consciousness.
In the connective systems between the thymus,
brain,
heart,
and gut is where you can highjack temporal awareness.
That is another limiting system that was put inside us,
however,
it has backfired on the temporal manipulators.
It gives us other *backdoor frequencies* of awareness through the temporal body.


Temporal highjacking has been around since the dawn of time.
The whole point of it is to manipulate our capacity to time stamp.
Interlopers discovered the infinite journey of soul then tried to figure out where,
when,
and how they might create an incoherent pattern and get a soul trapped in an era of history.
They could then generate a global narrative of mass distraction for the purpose of DNA Farming and hinder the *I am* consciousness from again entering the sea of consciousness.

Temporal manipulation started forty-eight to fifty-five thousand years ago.
Not all life forms practiced temporal manipulation.
It was about limiting the amount of life forms on the surface of the earth.
Particular DNA lineages were not receptive to this temporal manipulation.
We went from nine-hundred thousand different forms to one-hundred and thirty-five thousand.
This is the basis of DNA farming.
This is how they manipulate and limit who is going to be on the farm.



The apparatus of infinite interconnectivity is the simultaneous existing network of selves.
This forms the hub of interconnectivity,
part of our precognitive and postcognitive workforce.
The unvanquished dream is an aspect of the infinite interconnectivity,
giving us even greater connection to all the versions of ourselves sharing that perspective.
The unvanquished dreamer of peace comes in here too.
It connects to all the forgotten and remembered oceans of awareness,
the many seas of consciousness,
layered atop all form of thought,
awareness,
to connect them in a single time-space location.
It's a state of being that can walk on time.
