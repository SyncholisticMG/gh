## Mandela Effect

The Mandela effect is the karma of all those who've been manipulated throughout time,
as well as a bleed though from other times.
The system has shifted our reality and moved soul shards on to other realities so our memories would be fragmented.
It is a way for the universe to put everything back to neutral and help us to find the forgotten pieces of ourselves,
the pieces and parts that has been manipulated and put outside of time.

In the *Mandela revocation* we get all the fractured pieces
&mdash;
lost and found implicate orders
&mdash;
together for the celestial medium of peace journey.
There are versions of ourselves lost in void space who never got resolution and we,
as the manifesting being of the now,
can resolve that paradox through creating experiences and legacies.
Through different perception and perspective we can generate manifestations on the forgotten side so they are no longer forgotten and the system must now deal with them as remembered not forgotten.

Forgotten selves are selves who no longer have a frequency of time in the celestial karmic system.
As we enter the celestial medium journey,
we can reconnect to the spiritual celestial commerce exchange market.
Originally here on earth,
there have been certain beings and technologies such as the different galactics,
the DNA farmers:
Elohims,
Reptilians,
Orions,
Annunaki,
Arcturians,
Sirians,
who had different ways of perceiving the galactic commerce network through technology.
They began manipulating the flow of energy between star systems with technology even though they had not achieved celestial medium status in their spiritual journeys.
They were entangled observers using technology that had simulated unentangled observer technology.
This allowed them manipulation within thousands of years instead of millions of years.
Those original DNA manipulating beings thought they were Gods.
They kept manipulating DNA and the flow of energy between celestial sources allowing them to farm all DNA on a grand scale.

The forgotten selves are part of your forgotten workforce.
They are trying to get back into the zone where your precognitive workforce can perceive them.
They are aspects no longer connected to the nonlinear soul.
Their original linear time was erased.
They are trying to get out of this erased time back into non-linear time.
There is a network of forgotten selves that works together to be remembered.
The Mandela effect is a broadcast to all forgotten selves in awareness,
unawareness,
time and no-time.
Wherever life has gone,
even if it has been erased,
there is an opportunity,
a portal back to the hub of interconnectivity.
It can be perceived as the trans-galactic exchange system between eras of light.
Those forgotten selves will integrate with your precognitive and postcognitive workforce and no longer be forgotten but remembered and added to our akashic record.



They can represent themselves in infinite amounts of ways.
It all depends on how long they have been forgotten and what gifts they have to offer.
At the end of the Mandela revocation you are talking to every forgotten version of yourself,
so everyone of your peacekeepers may be remembered and reconnected to the fifth world of peace,
the unvanquished dream in all existing realms.
The original founder beings moved on to other universes.
Our other selves are the ones searching for the lost Mandela effects.
It is our responsibility to indicate to our precognitive and postcognitive workforce that it should be a priority to find every aspect of our forgotten selves up to nine hundred degrees of separation from us in this phase of awakening.
