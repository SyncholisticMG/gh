## Unvanquished Dream

The apparatus of infinite interconnectivity is the simultaneous existing network of selves.
This forms the hub of interconnectivity,
part of our precognitive and postcognitive workforce.
The unvanquished dream is an aspect of the infinite interconnectivity,
giving us even greater connection to all the versions of ourselves sharing that perspective.
The unvanquished dreamer of peace comes in here too.
It connects to all the forgotten and remembered oceans of awareness,
the many seas of consciousness,
layered atop all form of thought,
awareness,
to connect them in a single time-space location.
It's a state of being that can walk on time.
