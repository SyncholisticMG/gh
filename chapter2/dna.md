## DNA

DNA is part of the founder’s technology.
It is the connective tissue from the ocean of awareness and sea of consciousness to a light based wisdom,
intelligence,
and consciousness for any animated biological or non-biological entity.
It was fundamental when this universe was being created,
a unique experience compared to other universes.
There are many variations of DNA.
Non-biological DNA is solidified matter which can have DNA based rungs and structures within its growth patterns,
with its own inherent intelligence.
The crystal and mineral communities don’t need to walk to have an experience.
Walking is a unique experience.
An entire line of creation springs from it.

The DNA strand organization,
or the strands themselves,
create the weave of the DNA,
the encoding of the strands.
Every strand represents a different level and capacity of memory storage.
They enfold into an implicate order of greater awareness.
DNA can store frequencies of time.
This how we remember past lives,
but not the only way.
There are other ways to remember past lives.
The organization of your strands,
and the rungs that connect your strands,
determine how much you can remember from past lives.
Certain strands block out all past lives
&mdash;
negative strands of wisdom and awareness.
Many people within the awakening will replace negative with positive strands.
On the other side of the awakening new strands will be added to our capacity.
