## DNA

DNA is part of the founder’s technology.
It is the connective tissue from the ocean of awareness and sea of consciousness to a light based wisdom,
intelligence,
and consciousness for any animated biological or non-biological entity.
It was fundamental when this universe was being created,
a unique experience compared to other universes.
There are many variations of DNA.
Non-biological DNA is solidified matter which can have DNA based rungs and structures within its growth patterns,
with its own inherent intelligence.
The crystal and mineral communities don’t need to walk to have an experience.
Walking is a unique experience.
An entire line of creation springs from it.

The DNA strand organization,
or the strands themselves,
create the weave of the DNA,
the encoding of the strands.
Every strand represents a different level and capacity of memory storage.
They enfold into an implicate order of greater awareness.
DNA can store frequencies of time.
This how we remember past lives,
but not the only way.
There are other ways to remember past lives.
The organization of your strands,
and the rungs that connect your strands,
determine how much you can remember from past lives.
Certain strands block out all past lives
&mdash;
negative strands of wisdom and awareness.
Many people within the awakening will replace negative with positive strands.
On the other side of the awakening new strands will be added to our capacity.





DNA is eighty percent memories.
This is a fundamental understanding.
Science and spirituality must realize this.
We live in a photonic light reality with rules
&mdash;
how we incarnate,
express,
exchange,
and pass on.


```
All the world’s a stage,
And all the men and women merely players;
They have their exits and their entrances;

Shakespeare  As You Like It
```


DNA is the encoding,
the soul.
The light body is the cipher that decodes and unpacks the experience.
As we come back many times to the same type of living,
we store memories in DNA lineages
&mdash;
bloodlines
&mdash;
This is how we imagine immortality in the infancy of self-awareness
&mdash;
born again and again into a lineage with our stored memories.
Our soul family incarnation process aligns us to the bigger concept of perpetuity.
The search is always for the immortal soul,
the final state of being.



```
One generation passeth away, and another generation cometh: but the earth abideth for ever.

Ecclesiastes 1:4
```



We don't teach DNA lineage on the planet anymore.
We are looking at DNA through the lens of the fourth industrial revolution.
How can we hack it,
spike it,
tweak it.
We're like the monkeys beside the black obelisk in Stanley Kubrick's *2001: A Space Odyssey*.
DNA is light in another form,
visible in one spectrum and invisible in another.
Memory is not physical.
It's a form of light stored in an experience.
​​​​​​​As streams of consciousness we have thousands of sub-carrier codes of millions experiences inside us.
We only need tune into the memory and we can go into that stream of experience at any scale we desire.



Our forms are programmed to harmony
&mdash;
the other twenty percent of our DNA is not necessarily entangled with consciousness.
Seven percent is made up of harmony,
frequency,
and vibration.
The remaining thirteen percent corresponds to how the spiritual codes and contracts unfold in linear and none-linear time,
what agencies you work or don’t work with,
and how no-time beings can consciously entangle with the time based you to create a brand new contract that is need for change,
auditing of the self.
