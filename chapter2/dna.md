## DNA

DNA is part of the founder’s technology.
It is the connective tissue from the ocean of awareness and sea of consciousness to a light based wisdom,
intelligence,
and consciousness for any animated biological or non-biological entity.
It was fundamental when this universe was being created,
a unique experience compared to other universes.
There are many variations of DNA.
Non-biological DNA is solidified matter which can have DNA based rungs and structures within its growth patterns,
with its own inherent intelligence.
The crystal and mineral communities don’t need to walk to have an experience.
Walking is a unique experience.
An entire line of creation springs from it.

The DNA strand organization,
or the strands themselves,
create the weave of the DNA,
the encoding of the strands.
Every strand represents a different level and capacity of memory storage.
They enfold into an implicate order of greater awareness.
DNA can store frequencies of time.
This how we remember past lives,
but not the only way.
There are other ways to remember past lives.
The organization of your strands,
and the rungs that connect your strands,
determine how much you can remember from past lives.
Certain strands block out all past lives
&mdash;
negative strands of wisdom and awareness.
Many people within the awakening will replace negative with positive strands.
On the other side of the awakening new strands will be added to our capacity.


DNA is eighty percent memories.
This is a fundamental understanding.
Science and spirituality must realize this.
We live in a photonic light reality with rules
&mdash;
how we incarnate,
express,
exchange,
and pass on.


```
All the world’s a stage,
And all the men and women merely players;
They have their exits and their entrances;

Shakespeare  As You Like It
```


DNA is the encoding,
the soul.
The light body is the cipher that decodes and unpacks the experience.
As we come back many times to the same type of living,
we store memories in DNA lineages
&mdash;
bloodlines
&mdash;
This is how we imagine immortality in the infancy of self-awareness
&mdash;
born again and again into a lineage with our stored memories.
Our soul family incarnation process aligns us to the bigger concept of perpetuity.
The search is always for the immortal soul,
the final state of being.



```
One generation passeth away, and another generation cometh: but the earth abideth for ever.

Ecclesiastes 1:4
```



We don't teach DNA lineage on the planet anymore.
We are looking at DNA through the lens of the fourth industrial revolution.
How can we hack it,
spike it,
tweak it.
We're like the monkeys beside the black obelisk in Stanley Kubrick's *2001: A Space Odyssey*.
DNA is light in another form,
visible in one spectrum and invisible in another.
Memory is not physical.
It's a form of light stored in an experience.
​​​​​​​As streams of consciousness we have thousands of sub-carrier codes of millions experiences inside us.
We only need tune into the memory and we can go into that stream of experience at any scale we desire.



Our forms are programmed to harmony
&mdash;
the other twenty percent of our DNA is not necessarily entangled with consciousness.
Seven percent is made up of harmony,
frequency,
and vibration.
The remaining thirteen percent corresponds to how the spiritual codes and contracts unfold in linear and none-linear time,
what agencies you work or don’t work with,
and how no-time beings can consciously entangle with the time based you to create a brand new contract that is need for change,
auditing of the self.




To use our DNA instrument to the fullest capacity,
to tap into our skills,
we need to stop giving away our core energy.
Instead of preserving and tapping into our own source energy connection we keep using the background electromagnetic frequencies to stay motivated
&mdash;
the white noise of our spiritual ghetto.
There are so many voices now,
echoing through our heads like a hundred tourists visiting an echo chamber in the Grand Canyon
&mdash;
self-help nonsense with no understanding of the deeper strata of consciousness and existence;
an endless parade of hawkers projecting their bellowing pitch in the thoroughfare,
stocks,
bonds,
cryptos,
minerals,
security,
prosperity,
success;
family narratives of fear and doubt inherited by unconscious epigenetic propagation;
a million and one voices echoing through the consciousness of the twenty-first century man and woman.
How do we ever hear silence?


There comes a point where the living algorithm of life transcends into the ocean of consciousness.
How do we get there anchored down by the consciousness minutia of our time,
a time of vast technological advancement that has increased rather than decreased the burden of survival.
Only humanity,
alone among creatures on this planet,
works against its own best interest,
or can be persuaded to do so quite easily.  
We're not an equation.
we're not just binary numbers.
We're so much more than that.
The broken man,
the man on the cross,
has been the template for some time,
and it's still working today.
It's not who or what we are.
The fetish of deconstruction has poisoned the world.
We are a holistic creation creation,
the human being,
living in a holistic system we voluntarily left under the blindness of trauma.
Science,
cosmology,
economics,
and spirituality should have been unified generations ago.
They were,
in fact.
The Yugas of Vedic astrology are real
&mdash;
the gold,
silver,
bronze,
and iron age of the western esoteric syllabus.


Our environment does not activate us by itself.
This is the free will choice of the sentient being.
It has to be in our fate,
our fetus planning,
to even kindle the curiosity to look at the invisible webs of creation.
Sooner or later we are taken within to complete the journey to knowledge.
External sources can provide the initial catalyst
&mdash;
a book,
a retreat,
encountering an awakened person,
initiation into spiritual practice,
or plant propelled journeys into the fourth and fifth dimensions,
ayahuasca,
peyote,
mushrooms,
or any other number of chemical to light stimulants in various shamanic cultures throughout the earth
&mdash;
but none may be considered a path unto themselves,
and they must be abandoned once they have proved out.
Yes,
there are other dimensions.
Now choose a path,
a discipline,
a practice and earn it.
