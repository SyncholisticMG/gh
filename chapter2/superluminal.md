## Superluminal Thinking

Superluminal thinking leapfrogs chemical experience as the basis of memory and consciousness.
Let's look at it backwards through photosynthesis.
A plant eats light and excretes oxygen.
Human beings live in a chemical experience until light enters consciousness.
It's the reverse of plants.
We consume elemental material here,
calories,
an inherently chemical process,
aided by a long digestive track,
and we use this energy,
the fuel for the human experience,
an integral part of our chemical existence,
to find the light in our consciousness.
Creation in a dual pole,
free will space can often be navigated by bookends,
opposites,
even irony as a conceptual understanding of the thesis,
because the opposites form contrasts,
and,
in a light based divine hologram,
without contrast we would not even discern the reality around us.
You see your reality,
your wife or husband,
your dog,
you car because the environment has light.
The light finds pockets and reflections,
and it finds places it can't go,
and from its presence are all forms etched.


Superluminal operates beyond the zeros and ones of the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems.
The vagus nerve is fully functional.
All the chakras are open and interconnected through the central nervous system.
They are part of the superluminal experience.
The body adds the sensation that it canâ€™t process,
but it knows it's the unentangled observer in superluminal thought.
The body grounds us here,
but the consciousness can go beyond the speed of light to tens of millions of places and spaces simultaneously and collect millions of unique experiences in one millionth of a second and come back with it fully processed.
Then we go out and do it again and again until our cup is filled.
Superluminal thinking is more than we have learned,
read,
and studied.
It's knowingness going to the next level,
the next apprehensible sphere of experience.
It's subtle.
We won't have conscious cognition of it.
Everyone has experienced it,
Our level of practice will determines how fast we can apprehend it.
How is that possible?
You're already there.
You just don't know it.
You are unconscious to it.
The unconscious mind is connected to all knowledge.
The conscious mind creates a manageable data flow so you can persist in the illusion of the third dimension.
This is the basis of the Maya teachings in Buddhism.
Illusion was perhaps the wrong word.
It's more like a projection of light refracting through the atmosphere,
the projection itself emanating from the source of all our realities,
the place without sound or light that is neither dark nor silent,
Kabir's riddle.

The sound and light is all sound and light,
not just what can be experienced within the human sense ranges for hearing and sight.
All these inner worlds and universes,
if they are at all apprehendable,
are sustained by sound and light.
Anywhere these two persistent emanations of the prime creator are present we find contrasts and then forms and then realities.
It's this simple.
