## Karma


It's very easy to create karma through unawareness.
It's really the purpose of karma.
Karma is unawareness.
The karmic cycle produces awareness.
Karma is the simplest of things to understand once you build into the divine hologram.
It begins in our vaguest of awareness,
a silent petition,
a nudge for experience,
then,
somewhere in time we meet the circumstance that matches the silent petition.
We sign the contract and we cycle through the karma.
We live the experience,
first as an inner realization of what the impulse was,
then the manifestation,
then the realization and participation of others drawn to the karmic circumstance you have created,
as you will be drawn to others in an effort to resolve your karma,
and then the co-creator edits our creation in the form of,
you guessed it,
karma.



All of it is tied together by this sound and light that animates all the worlds where we create.
I suppose a canvas would be an appropriate metaphor.
We are an aspect of that which generates the sound and light.
We are an aspect of the prime creator.
We can co-create in the divine hologram.
It's all a co-creation down here,
at least insofar as human beings are concerned.
But we own what we create through cycles and consequences we didn't anticipate when we created.
This is the law.
Own what you think,
feel,
and do.
Of course the law is oft abused and circumvented.
Karma dumping and swapping
&mdash;
read scapegoating here
&mdash;
is an active market for third party consultants:
ritualists,
black magicians,
wizards,
artificial intelligences,
influential entities,
and too many more to list here.


Let's take a simple,
commonly experienced karmic pattern in our post-modern human life
&mdash;
the dysfunctional relationship.
Remember the last time you were in one.
Now remember when you allowed yourself to contemplate leaving the relationship.
You felt elated,
right?
It was a mixture of fear,
elation,
and tension.
Your precognitive workforce foreshadowed your emotional state.
That's how you were able to feel it.
You borrowed emotions from an as-of-then unlived future.

It's possible to have a parallel set of experiences.
There can be two parallel and simultaneous expressions of you existing at decision points.
The simultaneously existing *I am* chooses to walk out,
but you don’t,
or vice versa.
It makes no difference.
There's an infinite number of reasons why parallel cross overs happen.
It balances out the old karmic journey and creates a new one
&mdash;
the law of entanglement.


The great awakening transcends karma.
The awakening is the end of karma as universal law.
Karmic entanglement is no longer to be used as universal law.
Consciousness has evolved in our part of the galaxy.
The simplicity of karma can easily be intentionally abused.
It can lock beings into servitude without end.
The great awakening is going to backstop it.
A new system of resolution for thought,
word,
and deed is coming into place.





Karma as an entanglement experiment describes a quantum state that is not entirely independent of other states,
whether or not the individual objects are spatially separated.
As a result,
measurements performed on one system seem to instantaneously influence the other system(s) entangled with it.
None of the entangled states are isolated from one another.
Let’s look at Einstein's spooky law through the disentanglement and entanglement of the incarnate life form to source.
There's the entanglement within the hologram of a planet surface
&mdash;
subsurface and astral timelines
&mdash;
Separate from its surface timeline,
which is a DNA farm cultivated for harvest.
In this instance,
which is the example of earth,
source connection and disconnection become a primarily surface based experience.
That experience as a choice based process promotes the unlimited point of view
&mdash;
entangled and unentangled observer and experiencer of the universal and galactic sources
&mdash;
even though we are still embodied on a planetary surface separate from the solar system’s awareness.
Earth is a unique place of mass DNA farming.
It can lead to mass awakening through individual choice and responsibility.


The person creating an experiment is creating a construct that has connective tissue in the unseen world.
It allows data transference from the unseen layers of one DNA frequency to another.
Certain people have windows in the unseen layers which allow information to bleed through.
It bleeds through the five senses
&mdash;
as a processing system
&mdash;
to create a limited form of awareness in the entangled connected tissues.
The five senses create the sixth sense,
the intuition and awareness of it.
These connective tissues are all in the DNA.

Our DNA is entangled through the fetus in the womb planning.
It sets a multitude of potentials omnidirectionally.
There are plenty of people within a family who do not have a great connection to each other.
It's purpose is revealed in the spiritual contract.
Look at entanglement through thought constructs.
An example is living with a person for a long time and generating a point of view about them.
The construct makes for very easy interaction because of the many neural pathways between the two people.
This creates additional pattern recognition,
which results in more thoughts.
We then project the entire thought construct onto that person.
The construct must be broken at some point because it will impede objectivity.
It will become the norm.
We create and break these thought constructs,
the conscious aspect of entanglement.



We are not stuck in reincarnation.
We incarnate and reincarnate.
In the first part of our lives we might be a reincarnating soul.
If we break through the false propaganda we may become an incarnating soul.
Or we start as an incarnating soul,
then run into a karma cluster that makes us into a reincarnating soul,
repeating karmic cycles
&mdash;
a rinse and repeat that doesn't stop until you break out of the karma.
You can be both at the same time.
It depends on your ancestral lineage.
