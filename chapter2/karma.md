## Karma


It's very easy to create karma through unawareness.
It's really the purpose of karma.
Karma is unawareness.
The karmic cycle produces awareness.
Karma is the simplest of things to understand once you build into the divine hologram.
It begins in our vaguest of awareness,
a silent petition,
a nudge for experience,
then,
somewhere in time we meet the circumstance that matches the silent petition.
We sign the contract and we cycle through the karma.
We live the experience,
first as an inner realization of what the impulse was,
then the manifestation,
then the realization and participation of others drawn to the karmic circumstance you have created,
as you will be drawn to others in an effort to resolve your karma,
and then the co-creator edits our creation in the form of,
you guessed it,
karma.



All of it is tied together by this sound and light that animates all the worlds where we create.
I suppose a canvas would be an appropriate metaphor.
We are an aspect of that which generates the sound and light.
We are an aspect of the prime creator.
We can co-create in the divine hologram.
It's all a co-creation down here,
at least insofar as human beings are concerned.
But we own what we create through cycles and consequences we didn't anticipate when we created.
This is the law.
Own what you think,
feel,
and do.
Of course the law is oft abused and circumvented.
Karma dumping and swapping
&mdash;
read scapegoating here
&mdash;
is an active market for third party consultants:
ritualists,
black magicians,
wizards,
artificial intelligences,
influential entities,
and too many more to list here.


Let's take a simple,
commonly experienced karmic pattern in our post-modern human life
&mdash;
the dysfunctional relationship.
Remember the last time you were in one.
Now remember when you allowed yourself to contemplate leaving the relationship.
You felt elated,
right?
It was a mixture of fear,
elation,
and tension.
Your precognitive workforce foreshadowed your emotional state.
That's how you were able to feel it.
You borrowed emotions from an as-of-then unlived future.

It's possible to have a parallel set of experiences.
There can be two parallel and simultaneous expressions of you existing at decision points.
The simultaneously existing *I am* chooses to walk out,
but you donâ€™t,
or vice versa.
It makes no difference.
There's an infinite number of reasons why parallel cross overs happen.
It balances out the old karmic journey and creates a new one
&mdash;
the law of entanglement.



The great awakening transcends karma.
The awakening is the end of karma as universal law.
Karmic entanglement is no longer to be used as universal law.
Consciousness has evolved in our part of the galaxy.
The simplicity of karma can easily be intentionally abused.
It can lock beings into servitude without end.
The great awakening is going to backstop it.
A new system of resolution for thought,
word,
and deed is coming into place.
