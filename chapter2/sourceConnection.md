### Source Connection

Source connection is living in the light worlds,
the worlds above the elemental and chemical,
while grounded in the body,
finite and infinite at the same time.
We disconnect to contrast being connected.
It's an aspect of the lesson here
&mdash;
disconnection to understand connection.
We see this fundamental duality of the divine hologram everywhere
&mdash;
the yin and yan of the Tao,
Carl Jung's extraordinary work on duality and the shadow,
the juxtaposition to the light.
Not many voices have clearly articulated the disconnection teaching before.
The thread of life goes everywhere in the universe,
and that *thread* has a connectivity bandwidth exponentially beyond fiber optic,
and yet we,
this human race,
underwent the sensation of disconnection from source as an experience.
Realize what that means.
We're like Chilean miners trapped in a collapsed coal mine.
That's how the connected species in the sentience circus that is our galaxy see us,
hardcore.
As we have steadily moved into self-awareness as a species,
propelled as we were by Gutenberg,
the Western enlightenment,
the Industrial Revolution,
and,
lest we forget,
the iPhone,
we have seen this disconnection in the collective mind.
It rippled through with French Existentialism as chic twentieth century philosophy,
spurred on by the First World War,
no doubt,
the trauma of it,
the horror of it all.
One of the earliest portrait's of this dislocation would most certainly be Mister Kurtz,
from Joseph Conrad's *Heart of Darkness*,
the perfect literary tone struck for the twentieth century,
published in 1899,
a harbinger if ever there was one.
We are here to experience disconnection from source.
Oneness has no meaning if we donâ€™t understand the disconnection journey first.



The disconnection fractal is achieved by controlling the mind.
People don't take a moment to realize the enormous changes the human race has gone through since about 1890.
We now live in a completely man-made reality.
We travel in an enclosed environment propelled by a tar plumbed from the earth.
We have face to face conversations a thousand miles apart.
We can drive past digital billboards in city thoroughfares.
The Greek amphitheater is Netflix,
HBO,
and the cable channels.
Stonehenge is Joel Olsen on a big sports screen,
and the sacred is now profane.
This is spiritual conquest.
This is disconnection from source.
Literally every artifact of our organic culture has been incorporated and sold back to us.
Yet,
by reasons only explainable through cultural or regional programming,
we think it's unjust that Beijing select Catholic Archbishops instead of the Vatican,
and reincarnated Rinpoches instead of the Tibetans.
Regional and provincial narratives are more and more folding into global ones.
The global narrative teaches us false science,
false time by galactic timekeeping,
false history,
and belief systems which long ago should have given way to tangible and productive wisdom and knowledge traditions.
False light is a multidimensional technology commonly used here.
This is the source disconnection.
