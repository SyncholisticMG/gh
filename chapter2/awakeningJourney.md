### Awakening Journey



We live on a seventh dimensional seed planet.
Earth can teleport itself through time and space and seed worlds.
These seeded worlds are a blank sheet.
They have no akashic record.
The life force seeded by earth allows the new world to start growing with its own akashic record.

When we reconnect with source,
we become celestial mediums of peace.
We start using the womb chakras to create.
This was earth’s original plan.
This planet seeds life and brings the celestial minds into the planet to bond within the solar system.
THE celestial mind extends spiritual contracts to a sun.
The sun extends its contracts to the life force.
This connects it to the Galactic Celestial Commerce Market.

Awakening is kindling of the awareness strand of galactic commerce through celestial minds,
using celestial mediums as the guides and guideposts of the many frequencies of time.
This allows the ocean of awareness to go into the sea of consciousness and generate incarnations and reincarnations within a solar system.
A solar system is an energetic or a physical being within a world,
there to experience the strands of connectivity.

The earth was originally created for the unique experience of spawning new galaxies.
That was the design and intent.
The opposite has occurred.
The earth was heavily manipulated into becoming a DNA farm by means of the time travel wars.
Source connection became the greater mission.
Our sound and light fractal,
our dimension,
was hacked.
We were set upon the worship of false gods.
The misdirection or harvesting of human intentional energy is the basis of false fractals of the divine hologram.
It's a multidimensional expression of building our own prison.
We are co-creators.
Even if we've forgotten that,
they haven't.

Our mission is to experience the infinite ways soul connects and disconnects from source.
Earth offers a vast variety of messages and concepts to learn soul disconnection.
As we disentangle from the system of domination and control,
from past lives gone awry,
the more we can step into the understanding of true soul connection.
There are people on earth who planned hundreds of lives in advance to be here now to assist with this process.
We can call this the resistance of free earth.
They're here to find the soul codes among all of our species and complete them.
Domination and control could no longer keep us separate as soul families with a complete soul code.

The consciousness outside of time we can call the ocean of awareness &mdash;
the universal hologram &mdash; and it has the individual universal experience
within. The universal experience becomes a being on a planet who slips
into forgetfulness to experience finitude within a larger evolution. The
consciousness flow in the ocean of awareness allows the data to go from
wave to particle, the celestial medium to the DNA experience. The ocean
of awareness is the implicate order. There are different oceans of
awareness in other universes, many implicate orders, as every universe
creates different agendas, experiences, incarnations and reincarnations.
Not every universe uses incarnation. Many don’t use *I am* technology
like ours with seed and egg technology.

The ocean of awareness is part of the intricate waveform to which
quantum physics refers. It can be collapsed into particles. Every
particle can again be broken down into sub-points of observation. The
particle can be one DNA lineage and all DNA lineages simultaneously
based off what we choose to observe through it. The ocean of awareness
generates one particle which is technically the whole hologram, but we
perceive the hologram at different levels of awareness. The particle can
be tens of millions of lineages and tens of billions of worlds. An
individual observer works up the scale of observation that says: I am in
this lineage that is this particle on this planet, but it is also part
of a solar system, and this makes it a bigger particle, and this fractal
expands. Our local hologram is one particle. We are particles inside the
one particle. As individual particles we can perceive the next particle
&mdash; the solar system particle.
