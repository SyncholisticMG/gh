## Fairies

There exists entire realities sightly out of phase with humanity.
One of these is the fairy kingdom
&mdash;
dwarfs and gnomes.
We canâ€™t see them with our eyes,
but they are still here,
layered into the reality.
The sun is what creates the fundamentals of time,
the passing of the seasons,
the movement of the stars.
Roman numeral time has tried to hijack our awareness of that to make it central focus of our mind's resolution of time.
Places of power,
which naturally attract us,
have thinned veils between the layers of reality.
Our consciousness has more capacity to perceive,
receive,
understand,
and interact with the usually unseen layers of reality.
We are more in the quantum field than the chemical frequency in these locals.
A closed person visiting Normandy won't see the other layers of reality.
It's just a memorial,
but the veil in those places is very thin,
nevertheless,
the chemical reaction stops closed people from seeing the other side.
Tapping into the deeper layers of reality is based on how tuned in you are to allow those experiences.
The *I am* as the experiencer,
fully in the vagus nerve,
is intraconnected and interconnected,
and can simply experience different levels.
The *I am* as the observer can observe but not process the data.
