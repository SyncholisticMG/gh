## Temporal Manipulation

Our temporal awareness been manipulated.
A lot of weaponized time travel technology interferes with humanityâ€™s capacity to perceive time.
We can be heavily confused with our temporal awareness.
Confusion is an aspect of temporal distortion.
It can be sped up or slowed down.
Our temporal awareness is unconscious to time speeding up or slowing down.
Our individual temporal awareness determines our perception and perspective on how fast the algorithm can move.
Separate from the vagus nerve,
the thymus generates temporal awareness between the brain,
heart,
and gut,
then all three separate from unity,
making it easier to split consciousness.
In the connective systems between the thymus,
brain,
heart,
and gut is where you can highjack temporal awareness.
That is another limiting system that was put inside us,
however,
it has backfired on the temporal manipulators.
It gives us other *backdoor frequencies* of awareness through the temporal body.
