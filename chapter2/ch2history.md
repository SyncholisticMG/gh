## MIND HEART GUT SUPER HIGHWAY

Sometimes the mind processes better than the heart,
or the gut,
or the other way round.
Then there are certain pieces of information where the mind,
the heart,
and the gut have to work together.
Once the mind-heart-gut starts working together,
the analogical side of the mind
&mdash;
which compares two things
&mdash;
gets stronger,
along with the empowered programs that are with it.
This is why daily practice is so important.
Locality and non-locality are still based off the brain’s time-space location,
which is a marker signifying an anima of awareness and a flow of data.
We use the brain to interpret inter-dimensional frequencies of the multiple versions of self.
The brain is the instrument of experience.
It has a gut-brain and a heart-brain,
each with its own observance/
This allows processing of different time or no-time.
Brain,
mind,
heart,
and gut space are different natures of experience combined into one experience.

DNA communicates within the physical form.
It communicates from form to form through incarnations.
It communicates between incarnations.
It communicates to our light bodies.
It has the ability to go from chemical to light.
This understanding allows reasoned contemplation on many consequence theologies,
the wages of sin,
the sins of the father,
and karma itself,
whether applied to an individual,
a family,
a community,
a geography,
or any other distribution point;
it's all one DNA communication network,
the prime creator's backbone for several layers of experience,
straddling light and chemical,
which correlates to the physical body and the light body.
We are simultaneously living *I am* versions of ourselves,
scattered through time.
In low consciousness these other selves are unrecognized.
To quote Roy Batty from *Blade Runner*:
like *tears in the rain*.
In higher consciousness,
our awareness permits communication to multiple selves,
the consciousness of the earth itself,
and beyond.


The *I am*,
as the incarnate life form,
occupies and entangles consciousness within the body through three stages.
One,
the consciousness is in the brain-heart-gut.
The brain-heart-gut complex links to the central nervous system.
The central nervous system connects the entire fascia system through the vagus nerve
&mdash;
the central nervous system connector
&mdash;
as part of the DNA communication system.
Two,
consciousness is in the sympathetic nervous system (SN) and the parasympathetic nervous system (PSN).
Three,
consciousness is in the entire neural pathway network,
fascia,
dermis,
hairs,
the entire system.
It connects to the gallbladder which is intraconnected to the vagus nerve.
Every organ is intraconnected and interconnected to the vagus nerve.

The life form is part of the individual and collective experience.
Our life forms are on all different levels of awareness
&mdash;
planetary,
solar,
galactic,
and universal.
Contemplate the vagus nerve aligned to our magnetic North and South Pole.
The sympathetic and parasympathetic is our local space time.
The sympathetic drives our daily actions when the soul is in the body.
The parasympathetic drives the body in lucid dreaming and other spiritual states,
or when it is fully in self-defeating programs.
The sympathetic can also be self-defeating and kick the spirit out of the body.
It's driven to resolves karma.
It guides us like a compass to choose a variety of karma out of free will.
The vagus nerve is connecting to the North Pole,
our ancestors,
and to the South Pole,
our future generations.
We need to reclaim the vagus nerve as the truest spiritual sovereign authority we have.
Parasympathetic and sympathetic programs can kick us out of the body.
A sympathetic example would be road rage,
rebellious energy for the most part.
When the parasympathetic takes over and thinks it is the soul the ego and the shadow have made an alliance inside each other to manifest an internal villain,
a bully,
so the soul can’t be in the body.
In Jung’s psychology the subconscious looks upon the sympathetic as fight,
flight,
or freeze,
and it looks upon the parasympathetic as rest,
digest,
and relax.

Entanglement is the measure of how much consciousness is in control of the body.
It is measured through the vagus nerve,
the sympathetic nervous system,
and the parasympathetic nervous system.

The subconscious rest,
digest,
and relax vagus nerve connection is when we are in those spiritual moments where we are reclaiming our authority,
taking back our power and purging the vagus nerve.
Once we fully occupy the central vagus nerve with our consciousness,
we can flow it directly into the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system.
This is how the incarnate life form can retain lucid dream creations.
This explains why people run by programs have difficulty lucid dreaming.
It's difficult to make rich,
high quality memories.
The vagus nerve and the parasympathetic are connected to mystical experiences.
The sympathetic has neural pathways designed to use the five senses.
The five senses sum to the sixth sense,
the totality of the experience.

Think of a violin.
The parasympathetic system is the body of the violin.
The sympathetic system is analogous to the strings on the violin.
The vagus nerve is the bow.
Consciousness plays the violin.
The consciousness of the earth itself is the conductor.
The parasympathetic system is the resonance chamber.
These things are useless alone.
The string is nothing without the bow.
The vibration is nothing without the hollow chamber resonating with the body of the violin.
The fine tuning relates to how much the soul is in the body.

The consciousness of the planet is the conductor.
It hands out the sheet music,
the larger composition to which the individual instruments contribute
&mdash;
the blueprint of synchronicities.
Returning to our linear ocean of awareness metaphor,
the planet is the interconnection so the body
&mdash;
the life form
&mdash;
can have an intra experience with the planet.
This may be alone,
with individual family members,
cultures,
religions,
anything in the sheet music provided by the consciousness of the planet.
In this orchestration we seek harmony to make direct signature frequency matches.
The planet simultaneously exists in the ocean of awareness and the sea of consciousness.
The planet’s celestial mind is the medium between these two levels of awareness as well as the planet itself manifested in time and space so that beings living inside it can have a s set of unique experiences.
This applies to every planet in the universe,
with only a few exceptions.
The celestial mind of the planet is intraconnected with the celestial mind of us,
the life forms,
as well as intra connected with the ocean of awareness and the sea of consciousness manifesting in physical and non-physical space.

We want vagus nerve,
sympathetic,
and parasympathetic sovereignty.
This permits intra and interconnection to our celestial minds.
The journey is in maintaining sovereign connection as an ongoing experience until the experience is second nature.
At this unfoldment we can achieve other forms of embodiment.
We can leave the body and not lose control of the three aspects of consciousness entanglement.
We can create versions of ourselves in other places,
spaces,
and times.
This is our legacy as multidimensional and multi-functional beings.
We can adapt form to communicate with other places,
spaces,
and species.
Sovereignty is earned when the soul can leave at will.
DNA was designed so when we reach a certain frequency we are no longer solely within chemical experience.
Chemical exchanges are fundamental to the life forms living in this third density.
Our journey is from chemical to light.
The water
&mdash;
the fluids
&mdash;
that comprise the atoms of our bodies become a resonant amplifier.
Light based experiences happen through the refraction of water.
The soul is the light inside the body.
The water and fluid are refracting it by chemical reaction.
When you shine light through water or a prism there is no chemical separation of the prism of light.
Thoughts can be implicate and explicate at the same time
&mdash;
orgasmic experiences,
love,
and fundamental experience without thought.


Reincarnation was a trap that created karmic entanglements.
To get back to celestial mediumship,
reincarnations are optional and free willed for karmic resolution.
We achieve multidimensional living and realize leaving here was never truly the goal.
Multidimensional existence is the goal.
We can generate a part of ourselves that continues the journey while having many other parts of ourselves in other places.
The *I am* apex presence roots uncontested in the here and now.
Reincarnation and some forms of incarnation became competitive reduction journeys.
The entire experience of death is set to change.
Our lives will go to three hundred years,
five hundred,
seven hundred years in one go.
The passing over experience will persist to finish this era of light’s karmic accounts.
Our capacity to plan future lives with twenty to thirty percent of our life memories,
hundreds of millions of years as our database for mapping future lives.


We're not put on our mother’s heart for days after birth with the umbilical cord connected.
This is the natural law of harmony.
It's so simple the slightest sophistry devolves us of spiritual inheritance.
Birthing in hospitals with *licensed* medical personnel and limited bed time due to economies of utility does not complete the first synchronizing of the child.
Our *I am* technology has to come out quickly in our body in the present system.
Everything is set to slow down.
The future will see more natural birthing.
Pregnancy will be between nine and twenty-five months.


There are children here now with a good part of their memory available to them.
They might be ahead of time and lack parental guidance.
The fetus in the womb planning is set to change as well.
The mother and father will co-plan the spirit journey before the fetus even enters the womb.
It will be light based planning from the outset while fully incarnate in this third density.
This is multidimensional living.
This is the great leap forward,
no offense to Mao Zedong.
He had the concept right.
It was the context he lacked.
A whole new human race is ready to step out of the chrysalis of time and spread its magnificent and colorful wings.
This is the promise



## Spacial Awareness

Physical movement entangles us with individual and collective consciousness,
oscillating between explicate and implicate.
We change environment and move through different levels of consciousness.
We alter the existing.
Our consciousness is acted upon by fluctuating fields of electromagnetic energy.
Epigenetics discovered our genes are made up of fifty percent DNA and fifty percent protein.
Genes are not self-actualizing.
The proteins comprise the structure of the human body,
defining shape and influencing behavior in an ongoing attempt to balance charge and polarity from the environment.

Our individual bubble of reality gets enriched in experience and memory through the journey on the celestial neural pathway.
We go from one hologram to another in the expansion we call the orchestra of consciousness.
The neural pathways are an assemblage of proteins that move the body and help it to function.
We all know how to walk through this reality.
The celestial mind generates the divine holograms through which our bodies have experience.
All living consciousness is part of the symphony.
The light and sound which creates and sustains all the realities allows us to manage a fractal of it which we call our reality.
Our very reality on an individual by individual basis is a co-created reality between us and the material of the hologram itself,
sound and light,
which sustains our physical and inner existence.
Our dreams are expressed in sound and light.
There are fractals within fractals.
Culture is another fractal,
whether it be a pueblo in a mountain village in Colombia,
or the frenetic consumerism inspired by Madison Avenue.
It's a hologram overlaying and interacting with your personal hologram.
It binds us to an era of history.
Our culture has Roman numeral time,
which is not our true accurate time stamp.
It may use elements of it,
though.
Our culture binds us to an era of history.
It's part of the hologram of resolution.
Our entanglement into the culture’s hologram of roman numeral time builds up a weave into the individual hologram.


## Weather


Weather is an intricate part of our history,
part of what is going on at the time.
Weather is intraconnected to programmed water.
The programmed water of an era of history determines our weather patterns.
We as human beings are constantly imprinting on the water on an individual level to create a collective.
Animals and plants are conscious beings of choice,
even though they haven’t been given the rights,
duties,
or responsibilities of beings of awareness,
allowing the experience love.
Our laws don’t include them as part of that.
The rest of the network of life and our laws are separate from that through conscious entanglement with the narrative.
Trees,
plants….
anything that has consciousness and experiences life as part of the planet.
Our journey into the great awakening is knowing the network that is out there.
We are responsible not to step on the journeys of all the other things living here.
As part of the great awakening the ducks,
the dolphins,
the whales,
all of them are part of the awakening too.
It is not just solely for us humans.



## Mineral Consciousness


Crystals and rocks are communities of beings that are part of the sea of consciousness,
too.
Crystals are part of the implicate and explicate order,
simultaneously entangled and unentangled.
We can imprint entangled narrative perceptions and agendas upon crystals with our precognitive workforce.
A crystal will do what it needs to do for us based off how our precognitive workforce manifests the matter.
They are part of the ocean of awareness that becomes part of the sea of consciousness as animated matter.
Crystal allows us access to the ocean of awareness and the sea of consciousness based on our capacity to perceive,
receive,
process,
and manifest it.
The crystalline structure is materialized,
no longer a fluid ocean of awareness or sea of consciousness.
When we enter the sixth and seventh dimensions,
crystallization is the lower end technology for generating matter based awareness.

## FAIRIES

There exists entire realities sightly out of phase with humanity.
One of these is the fairy kingdom
&mdash;
dwarfs and gnomes.
We can’t see them with our eyes,
but they are still here,
layered into the reality.
The sun is what creates the fundamentals of time,
the passing of the seasons,
the movement of the stars.
Roman numeral time has tried to hijack our awareness of that to make it central focus of our mind's resolution of time.
Places of power,
which naturally attract us,
have thinned veils between the layers of reality.
Our consciousness has more capacity to perceive,
receive,
understand,
and interact with the usually unseen layers of reality.
We more in the quantum field than the chemical frequency in these locals.
A closed person visiting Normandy won't see the other layers of reality.
It's just a memorial.
The veil in those places is very thin,
but the chemical reaction is stopping them from seeing the other side.
The tapping into the deeper layers of reality will be based off your choice and how tuned in you are to allow those experiences.
The *I am* as the experiencer,
fully in the vagus nerve is intra and inter connected,
can easily experience all those different levels whilst the *I am* as the observer can still observe but not necessarily process the data.
This would be the marching band in motion getting back to our musical metaphor.
There are those watching and listening to the orchestra and there are the ones playing and creating the music,
being in the stadium as observers

2.
   TEMPORAL AWARENESS generated in the incarnate life form
Q: What generates the temporal experience,
in the bodymindspirit as a complex unit?
The Thymus,
high heart! They call it the high heart because it serves as the doorway for our higher spirit to come into the DNA experience.
According to medical science the thymus is called a one and done gland.

The thymus incapsulates the heart through the pericardium where it is originally created.
When the heart starts to grow from its original multicellular structure,
it is the thymus that creates the temporal awareness and it remains there assisting the magnetic flux of the heart to be harmonised with time.
Inside the thymus are neural pathways that allow the transformation,
transmutation and transfiguration of multiple forms of time between the heart and the brain,
the heart and the gut and then individually,
the heartbraingut,
as a unified structure.
The thymus and the lymph system contain those special neuropathways separate of the entire central nervous system and separate of the vagus nerve.
It is like its own morse code system.


Q: Has our temporal awareness been manipulated?
Yes,
that is where a lot of time travel technology as a weapon will interfere with humanity’s capacity to perceive time.

They can heavily confuse us on our temporal awareness.
Confusion is one thing but if they can change the gauge of time inside you like if one hour takes two hours,
what are they doing to you? They are speeding up or slowing down time.
Your temporal awareness is not aware that time is sped up or slowed down compared to everyone else’s.
This individual temporal awareness determines our perception and perspective on how fast the algorithm can move.
Being separate from the vagus nerve,
the thymus generates temporal awareness between the brain,
heart and gut and then all three separate in unity which makes it easy to split consciousness.

Q: Can you expand on that? In the connective systems between the thymus,
the brain,
the heart and the gut is where you can highjack temporal awareness.
That is another limiting system that was put inside us but it also backfired on them.
They didn’t realise it would give us other backdoor frequencies of awareness through the temporal body.


Q: What does splitting of consciousness mean and how would that relate to the *I am*? You take somebody out of their original body and you put him into a simulated body somewhere else and then you break down their consciousness into hundreds of different pieces.
Then you spread them throughout time with individual missions.
That is the classic SSP Super Soldier way of doing things.
Those would be soul shards of yourself rather than *I am* selves,
when they break you up like that,
just bigger than normal shard pieces.
They are still connected to the *I am* selves but they are just pieces of an *I am* that has been shattered into many pieces.
Remember,
despite the split the piece itself still has access to the hologram even though they convinced it that it doesn’t.


Q: What is the Mandela effect and what are we doing when working with the Mandela Revocation? In the MANDELA REVOCATION we get all the fractured pieces,
the lost and found implicate orders together for the celestial medium of peace journey,
the peacekeeper,
peacemaker journey.
The Mandela effect is a consequence and retribution of karma for all those that have been manipulated throughout time as well as a bleed though from other times.
The system has shifted our reality and moved soul shards on to other realities so our memories would be fragmented.
It is a way for the universe to put everything back to neutral and help us to find the forgotten pieces of ourselves,
the pieces and parts that has been manipulated and put outside of time.
There are versions of ourselves lost in the VOID SPACE who never got resolution and we,
as the manifesting being of the now,
can resolve that paradox through creating experiences and legacies.
Through different perception and perspective we can generate manifestations on the forgotten side so they are no longer forgotten and the system must now deal with them as remembered not forgotten.

Q: What do you mean when you talk about the forgotten selves? Forgotten selves are those that do no longer have a frequency of time in the celestial karmic system.
As we enter the celestial medium journey we can reconnect to the spiritual celestial commerce exchange market.
Originally here on earth,
there have been certain beings and technologies such as the different galactics,
the DNA farmers: Elohims,
Reptilians,
Orions,
Annunaki,
Arcturians,
Sirians,
who had different ways of perceiving the galactic commerce network through technology.
They began manipulating the flow of energy between star systems with technology even though they had not achieved celestial medium status in their spiritual journeys.
They were entangled observers using technology that had simulated unentangled observer technology.
This allowed them manipulation within thousands of years instead of millions of years.
Those original DNA manipulating beings thought they were Gods.
They kept manipulating DNA and the flow of energy between celestial sources allowing them to farm all DNA on a grand scale.

Q: Can the forgotten selves be part of our precognitive workforce? They are a part of forgotten workforce and they are trying to get back into the zone where your precogs can perceive them.
They are aspects that are no longer connected to the nonlinear soul.
Their original linear time was erased and they are trying to get out of this erased time back into non-linear time.
There is a network of forgotten selves that works together to be remembered.
The Mandela effect is a broadcast to all forgotten selves in awareness,
unawareness,
times and no-times.
Wherever life has gone,
even if it has been erased,
there is an opportunity,
a portal back to the hub of interconnectivity.
It can be perceived as the trans galactic exchange system between eras of light and there is more to that.
Those forgotten selves will integrate with your pre- and post cognitive workforce and no longer be forgotten but remembered and added to your Akashic Records.
They have not been part of your AR being in forgotten space.
They can represent themselves in infinite amounts of ways.
It all depends on how long they have been forgotten for and what gifts they have to offer.
At the end of the Mandela Revocation you are talking to every forgotten version of yourself,
so everyone of your peacekeepers may be remembered and reconnected to the 5th world of peace,
the unvanquished dream in all existing realms.
The original founder beings moved on to other existing universes.
Our other selves are the ones searching for the lost Mandela Effects.
It is our responsibility to indicate to our pre- and post cognitives that this should be a priority to find every aspect of our forgotten selves upto 900 degrees of separation from us in this phase of awakening.

Q: When did the Super Soldier Program get implemented? Temporal high jacking has been around since the dawn of time.
The whole point of it is to manipulate our capacity to time stamp.
Remember,
they discovered the infinite journey that the soul takes and then tried to figure out where,
when and how they could interfere or create an incoherent pattern to get a soul trapped in an era of history.
They could then generate a global narrative of mass distraction for the purpose of DNA Farming and hinder the *I am* consciousness to re-enter the Sea of Consciousness.

Q: Why choose the Thymus not use the Vagus nerve? This is time itself,
gut time vs heart time,
vs brain time,
versus unified gutbrainheart time.
For example when you are taking a multiple choice test in high school,
and you’ve got 50 questions to do in an hour you have roughly 1 min and 2 secs to answer each question.
That is the brain calculation of time.
The heart is obviously a part of that equation but it will only see the one hour as the potential of the experience.
The gut will be operating intuitively,
like can I give myself the best possible opportunity of having gut intuition during this span of time?
A third of all our central nervous pathways are in our gut,
a third in our heart and a third in our brain.
When you have all of them working together you have TEMPORAL AWARENESS with three forms of perception and perspective that can guide the many forms of consciousness through the journey of awareness.
The bodymindspirt as a complex being has many forms of awareness.
The foundation of temporal awareness that give us a calculation journey stem from the brain,
the heart and the gut.
They are the factors that check in with local reality time.
The gut,
the heart and the brain have a deep awareness of the energies that surround us as all electromagnetic frequencies are effected by their environment.
The Schumann Resonance is the background frequency of electromagnetics that is effected by solar winds and radiation,
the actual magnetics of the planet.
This is also how the celestial mind communicates to us and generates time in the temporal awareness.
It represents an opportunity for consciousness expansion.
If you feel that you respond to the spikes of the Schumann Resonance it might say to you that have all this electromagnetic thinking juice and you are not doing anything with it.

Q: When did Temporal Awareness manipulation start? Roughly 48-55,
000 years ago but not all the forms had it,
not all of them would take temporal manipulation that way.
Again,
it was all about limiting the amount of forms on the surface.
Something like you are not going to live on the surface because your particular DNA lineage won’t be receptive to this temporal awareness manipulation.
That’s why they went from 900,
000 different forms to 135,
000.
This is all about the basis of DNA farming and how they would manipulate and limit who was going to be in the farm.

Q: How can we take back our temporal awareness and use it to our advantage? Getting our gut health back? Our micro organism in the gut,
that has a life span as part of the cojoined frequency that we are,
then generates a natural immune system in the blood,
through the marrow in the skeletal system.
The heart filters and processes that information together with the brain into higher levels of awareness to figure out what to do with our many agendas.
This will then also improve our intra and intercommunication.
Our capacity to connect to other temporal realms through dreamtime will increase through multiple points of temporal awareness.

Q: What other temporal realms are there? Your dream realm,
it has its own frequency of time and it is fair to say there are thousands of dream realms out there with thousands of different frequencies of time.
Your gut will basically have its own checklist of all the places it has been to and will be able to verify the temporal signature frequency,
meaning your gut will resonate with the frequency of being in the right time and space.
Most intuition comes from the gut and it depends on how the brain,
heart,
gut are connected.
Guthealth was ignored on purpose by conventional medicine,
death begins in the colon.

Q: How does EYE PATTERNS RECOGNITION fit into the concept of Consciousness Entanglement? Eye movements reflect on how we access,
perceive and process information in the consciousness field.
They are an indication if we are looking towards the future or the past.
We can use certain eye positions to access our memories and thoughts as well as create new ones and gain recognition on how to stay present,
outside of emotional entanglement.
Practicing those movements and positions allows the DNA instrument to gain more flexibility and access to the information in the conscious energy field.
