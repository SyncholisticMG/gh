## Weather


Weather is an intricate part of our history,
part of what is going on at the time.
Weather is intraconnected to programmed water.
The programmed water of an era of history determines our weather patterns.
We as human beings are constantly imprinting on the water on an individual level to create a collective.
Animals and plants are conscious beings of choice,
even though they haven’t been given the rights,
duties,
or responsibilities of beings of awareness,
allowing the experience love.
Our laws don’t include them as part of that.
The rest of the network of life and our laws are separate from that through conscious entanglement with the narrative.
Trees,
plants….
anything that has consciousness and experiences life as part of the planet.
Our journey into the great awakening is knowing the network that is out there.
We are responsible not to step on the journeys of all the other things living here.
As part of the great awakening the ducks,
the dolphins,
the whales,
all of them are part of the awakening too.
It is not just solely for us humans.
