Merriam Webster's Online Dictionary
Space-time is an infinite set of co-ordinates atop existence. We live in a reality defined by experience. We tell stories. They have a beginning, a middle, and an end. We chronicle our stories. The first person who ever took pen to paper did so in fear, and this is why human beings are enmeshed in stories. We love the drama. We love to create it, and we love to consume it. Drama is tension. Human beings say they want peace, but it's kind of a scam when you're honest. If we wanted peace we wouldn't create tension in our lives, but without the tension we can't live the drama. It's best just to be honest. If you lie about it you're more susceptible to programming, which proliferates the world, hundreds of broadcast networks and movie studios all over the world — Hollywood, Bollywood, Hong Kong, Shanghai, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, British Broadcasting Corporation, and too many more to list — all servicing humanity's insatiable appetite for programming, which is drama for the most part, which, as we have clearly established, is tension. Yet, if you walk up to any human being and ask them if they prefer peace to tension they will tell you they prefer peace. Isn't that strange?
It really isn't that strange when you understand what's going on down here. On the spiral ladder of our deoxyribonucleic acid — DNA by its affectionate abbreviation — we hold an evolving marker of our place in time-space which also represents our level of consciousness. This marker is the sum of our experience — where experience is movement in time-space, and the drama, the tension, we create — and represents but a faction of our greater soul, and the experiences we have assimilated as a soul faction.
This marker is directly aligned with our level of responsibility because our level of consciousness is always equal to our level of responsibility. They are in a symbiotic relationship, consciousness and responsibility. DNA is in essence coordinates to where we fit in space-time, or, to stay with our narrative, how we've been written into the story. Our circumstance is our DNA, which is our story, which is our tension, which is our drama, which we wrote and act out ourselves, forgetting the author sleeps in our unconscious.
We have the story, creation, and we have the author, God and soul as a fractal of God, or the prime creator, as God is so anthropomorphically programmed into human consciousness as a being like us — two arms and legs, two eyes and ears, bipedal, and fond of long white beards — and we have the actor, soul as well, incarnate — sheathed really — in this body, borrowed from air, earth, water, fire, and ether.
The travail of the soul is to unlock levels of consciousness. It is a travail because we must suffer for it. New consciousness permits us to embody new experiences, to write, direct, and star in a more expanded story.
So why a hologram, and, more importantly, why a divine hologram? It's a hologram because it is light projected into a three dimensional manifestation. It's divine because the light comes from the prime creator, God. When we use the word hologram we get an idea of something mechanistic, of some malicious tinker on the other side of reality making it, and, therefore, it's all fake, a simulation, and therefore we are the victim of something. Nothing could be further from the truth, unless we can victimize ourselves, which we can and we do, because drama needs tension, and tension is stress, and volunteering for stress by manufactured tension is masochistic. By calling it a hologram, with all the mechanistic undertone, we make an object of our reality, something acting against us, a god, a devil, an angel, a demon, anything but ourselves. This is why we objectify our reality. This is why we call it a simulation, a matrix, a hologram. It's a lack of consciousness, a failure to attribute the divine to the light, and a stone deaf ear to the word, which is the sound which is the light, sustaining all the worlds in this sound and light manifestation. It's funny, because when you clue into it; it's everywhere.
She should have died hereafter.
There would have been a time for such a word.
Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow
Creeps in this petty pace from day to day
To the last syllable of recorded time.
And all our yesterdays have lighted fools
The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle.
Life’s but a walking shadow, a poor player
That struts and frets his hour upon the stage,
And then is heard no more. It is a tale
Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,
Signifying nothing.

Macbeth
William Shakespeare
Why would the end of time be marked and measured by syllables? Because it's all sound, and light is a form of sound. This is, of course, why we have so much tonal prayer and trance, whether it be Sufi dervishes spinning to an intoxicating Arabic song-like prayer, heavy on chanting, the persistence of mantra in yoga and meditation, long vowel sounds drawn out on the breath, or the deep throat singing of the Mongols, which, they say, allows them to speak to their ancestors, and Gregorian chanting in the Christian tradition. It's all about the sounds.
There are so many creation stories. The garden of Eden and the rather horrid unfolding of Genesis, the incredible tales of the turtle universe from the Iroquois Confederacy in Canada, or the novel, post-modern school room of soul narrative the new age favors. They're all versions of the same story. One of the more recent — only five hundred years ago — is the Anurag Sagar, orated by an illiterate weaver named Kabir Sahib, a satguru — which means true teacher — of his time. He ups the game big time. He introduces a creation story where God willed everything into existence with seventeen shabdas — sound currents — that animate all the dimensions and sub-dimensions that weave together reality. It's an incredibly precise addition to creation mythologies, and certainly the forebearer of all notions of at least a great many of our dimensions being simulations of sorts. Hence the divine hologram, which is the metaphor for creation used here, in this instance, a literal metaphor. It's true both figuratively and literally. The seventeen shabdas originate from a place that itself has no sound, but is not silent, and no light, but is not dark, the final riddle from the illiterate weaver.
We are not actuality creating anything in time. We are traversing it and enjoining an experience with it. We are seedlings in a cosmic garden, passing through experiences expressed in a specific form of life, and then, when sentience is achieved alongside language and culture, we go through any number of human expressions until we master the tool, the hu man form, a rather extraordinary instrument, as maligned as it has become in the First World, the newer, better hu man that seems just around the corner, the trans hu man, the super man made from man, Nietzsche's bastard let loose upon the world — nonetheless, a rather extraordinary instrument, the hu man form. We are inside a sound and light reality, one of many, and we traverse and enjoin experience with it, unaware we're inside it, until, by epiphany, the nature of the system reveals itself in form. The story was written before we lived it, even though it seemed like it was really happening for the longest of times. We are living the mapped out keys of the experiences. Every choice, path, and set of functions, every different type of life has been made available to us so we can embody the experience, mapped like a script, written into what we perceive to be a timeline, a bloodline, a clan, a tribe, a culture, a people, a place, a planet — stories within stories, managed by cosmic editors and keepers of time, all under a prime creator, an amorphous but fully conscious presence in everything we call life, unconditionally offering the experiences as an expression of its love. You believe as much already if you follow a prophetic religion. The prophets tell of a a story already written.
Do not diminish your position as a living and sentient being. You are creating within this world. Your free will choices unfold the story. As the story unfolds, you receive the blessings of the particular experience. Never feel overwhelmed or helpless. We are truly connected to the outcome of our unique choices. As we get further into this journey, we realize we're time traveling beings by nature. In no way is this experience linear. We are responsible for our creations forwards and backwards in time, and we can make alterations as we see fit — when our consciousness is so unfolded — by connecting to past and future versions of ourselves.
Eternity is in the present moment, mediated through attention and awareness, by perception and perspective, until we leave the celestial sphere, then, a new swath of perception opens. The outer frequency of this hologram unfolds into more and bigger holograms. This goes all the way up the scale of our awareness. Our perception allows us a greater, 360 ° view. Suddenly perspective has no direction, no horizon, no fade to black. It's everywhere, operating at a higher law of nature, but natural nonetheless. We are unentangled.
The Entangled Observer in the Implicate & Explicate Order
As we move past a subject, part of our brain continues to color in the past event, as if it were a live memory, until we completely disentangle from the subject. We do it all the time, so much we don't even notice we're doing it. We go to a party. We have a good time. We synchronize with the moment. Upon leaving, the energy of the party persists in us with a kind of half-life — still thinking and feeling the fun we had at the party and coloring the memory until our consciousness disentangles from the energetic imprint.
We want to stay with high frequency experiences, but we get disconnected — how and why? Sleep can disconnect us. An argument with a significant other can alter our frequency, but, even a few hours after the argument, it was still a fun party. Think of a kite and the wind that suddenly reconnects to the energy. Having a jarring accident could put a sudden end to a high frequency.
Then, the next month’s party at the same place has us coloring the experience before we even get there. We send our precognitive workforce there to experience it prior to the actual event.
Our state of perception influences us. When we think back on the party we are in the implicate, enfolded order, as opposed to being at the party, where we are in the explicate, unfolded order. The state of perception — implicate or explicate — determines how we perceive the physics of the environment. The physics of the environment, as well as the observer’s perception, changes as the observer moves between explicate to implicate order. The state of perception equals perspective. The perspective of the explicate order — when you are at the party — is different than the perspective of the implicate, the memory. No matter if you are spiritual, atheistic, or anything else, it's all quantum mechanics expressed in different words.
The entangled observer uses a deeper information process, while, with the unentangled observer, the information is in full flow, and there is no need to process it — it's already in their knowing. When you have infinite love co-creating with you, you must truly choose to be the disentangled observer. Go into your heart space. Create that vision in your mind and engage with the sacred, neutral observer, knowing information cannot change you unless you agree to it. Based on how the I AM now is understood and processed, it will either expand or contract your knowing. By making that sovereign choice to be the disentangled observer of the self means you get the fullest versions of yourself in the here and now.
You are the apex of your own hierarchical order. Say that in your mental heart space.
I am the apex of my own hierarchical order, and no other hierarchical system has control and domination within me. The entangled observer, going through the process of perception and perspective, is refining the thought structures. Every time you have an aha moment you go from implicate to explicate. You can be an implicate unentangled observer and be in the explicate observation simultaneously, but entanglement is a deeper choice to enter into it.
In this reality there are no real truths and facts because every time we go from implicate to explicate and back the memory has changed. This is what shatters space-time as the foundation of everything and creates plasticity of reality. Consciousness does not adhere to space-time per the rules of Newtonian physics. Why would it? Consciousness is not of matter, but it can exist within and experience matter. Thoughts and memories, even as part of the implicate and explicate order, are a chemical frequency in nature. There comes a point in light frequencies where we bypass the chemical frequency in nature, and we operate in a higher dimension where space and time are no longer relevant. Space-time is dependent on how the implicate and explicate order goes to chemical and light memory storage long term. This is when the DNA instrument of experience can have a 360 ° view of itself. Spiritual contracts can become part of the implicate and explicate order. This creates the time stamp on the linear side of the life form, or, the DNA instrument of experience. It also creates the adherence to the global narrative. The past, present, and future are irrelevant based off perception, but it is perception that gives it relevancy in the moment when the chemical memory becomes a light memory or in the case of high frequency, when we bypass chemical memories to create an experience.
The status of entanglement determines the outcome. Quantum physics works on the premise that everything is entangled. It places all significance on the observer without looking at the observer status of entanglement.
An unentangled observer can observe the quantum field without having an effect on it. It happens all the time. Observers are born into human form, sent into this world to create a record of it they then take back to where they came from. They do not interfere with the unfoldment of circumstance here. If they did, they would be entangled. There are numerous observers and collectives of observers that we might call off-world, able to observe us nonetheless. They are not influencing us, but they have a perception of us based on the observed data that is put back into their form of experience — their body, if you will. like the human form for us — or what we can call, however clinical, the DNA instrument. The experience is taken in as a flow, then perceived after the time of observation. This allows them to remain unentangled observers because they are two degrees of separation from the original observance. The DNA does not influence the observation because of the two degrees of observation from the observed. It is our birth right and legacy as human beings to do that too. The more degrees of separation the easier it is to become a quantum observer. As you untangle yourself from everything that will give you the choice to perceive from a place of non-definition. DNA has a light frequency in it beyond our understanding. Our consciousness can engage the unseen world and by using mystical linguistics our knowing can expand. As unentangled observer, no charge, no polarity can influence you. You have the unlimited point of view, in sacred neutrality where all information flows as an experience in expansion of your knowing. This is when the mystical becomes the norm.
An unentangled observer may be implicate and explicate at the same time. You don’t have to have an explicate explanation as a prerequisite to the implicate order. Every time the quantum field is accessed and observed, the access and observation creates a marker point in time and no-time that the implicate and explicate order is no longer defined separately but viewed simultaneously. You can call back all marker points in time to which you are a fixed point in space-time for spiritual resolution. When you become a fixed moment in space-time all of your simultaneously existing selves can tune into your finite point in time. Those particular marker points in time could be many eras of light apart, or the could represent a marker point in an era of light in which you became an apex of your DNA lineage of registry. You could liken it to puberty — that would be a marker point in time. The era of innocence ends. The adult with miles to go before it sleeps, and promises to keep, to borrow from Robert Frost, emerges. It’s a marker point in time, because a greater form of time stamping is created.
Sound is a form of light. Light makes up memories. Memories can be changed. Yes — memories can change. We can change our memories. We can change our past. This is the power given to every one of us, but few access it it a lifetime. It's just another forgotten part of the grand being we call soul.
The study of mnemonics is incorrect. The scientists understand the chemical part of memory, but not the light part. Past, present, or future memories are all frequencies of light. When we watch a video it is a slice of time. When we create a document, or read out loud with power, these are slices of time — we gather and form intent and imprint in us that has borders and boundaries to not allow beings of forced evolution into your frequency. It enforces the borders and boundaries saying: I am a match for global dreamtime awakening; I am a signature frequency match for my own dreaming self; I am a match for my own healing and mastery; I am a match for union and communion; I am not a match for hate and war; I am not a signature frequency match for bad relationships in my life.
This is what these revocations are for and if you read them from the heart, from a place of power, expanding the wholeness that is you, bringing the fullness of your sacred discipline, your sacred genius to mean what you say. Read them out loud as often as you can. Once you have found the power in your voice, record them. Listen is a deep meditative state. Hear your own version of power. Present your own signature frequency to that past incarnation of you and raise that frequency, that emanation of light, through sacred discipline and choice. These are choice points, markers in time. They project to a future version of yourself who may not be in that power or ready to get to the next level. Introduce yourself to yourself with this method and you begin to learn you are your greatest teacher, you are a signature frequency match for what you focus on. You are a match for great change when it has potent concepts behind it that directly connect to you. By way of these tools, powerfully applied in the physical present moment, we make a conscious choice to be the unentangled observer, to interpret more data and data sets at a superluminal thinking level, enforcing our sovereignty as divine co-creative celestial beings of the now.
The unentangled observer is not attached to information or its flow. Until we become the unentangled observer, we impact on situations purely through observation. We create another neutral observer external to us after this. We create it inside the divine hologram. We raise our light frequency to create that anima part, reaching towards the celestial medium journey, increasing our frequency until we are the celestial medium. This hasn’t manifested in the human information field yet. Nobody in science or spirituality is talking about it.
One might very easily have questions about judgment here. How do you participate in family, community, economy, government, and world affairs as an unentangled observer? Suspend judgment. Judgment is an attachment to this divine hologram we are born into. It's also a petition for experience. This is our unconscious understanding of irony. In order to detach we need to practice the unentangled observer. We can achieve a non-judgmental state, non-competition, equal co-creation, with non-hierarchical order. It is our natural state.
Judgment is a very unique perspective. There are certain high states of awareness that use judgment. Judgment is an ongoing challenge all consciousness is going through. Making something absolute is necessary to solidify concepts, but it can prevent greater states of awareness. Judgment is required to materialize concepts from the sea of awareness. This is another way of looking at materialism. It's not all just cash and cupidity. There are certain highly aware beings who are very judgmental. They've gone so far into concepts of good or bad it's their way or no way.
Traveling
There is a lot of past technology resurfacing in the field of consciousness. Remote viewing is an example. This is when the consciousness is trained to go somewhere and see and hear. The body is localized but the I am goes somewhere else in space or space-time. You might know this from films like The Men Who Stare at Goats. They mocked it in the film, but in real life it has been used by military and intelligence quite effectively. It precedes this modern utility, of course, and has been a part of human activities for quite some time, from tribal shaman to ancient priest classes in bygone times. It has its roots in Lemuria, the ancient civilization that existed alongside Atlantis. They pioneered the technology of the unentangled observer, a specialty within Lemurian DNA combined with the ancient Lemurian city technology of deep observance, like psychic telescopes, so they could remotely view anyone in the multiple universes as unentangled observers. When they became very practiced at the unentangled observer, it became a part of their DNA and they passed it on in lineages, like having an invisible cloak. That DNA became commercialized in the galactic genetics market — the primary exchange in the galaxy and the universes, by the way — to species who were spiritually, physically, and emotionally not ready for it, but they procured the DNA anyways, bought or stolen. This created the DNA wars and it's why DNA farming exists today. The original gene for the unentangled observer was added to other species through genetic mixing.
The unentangled observer technology was a DNA experience that could be traded with lineages and species compatible with it. It came with a price. Some species lost their sex organs and were forced to clone to reproduce. It depended on the level of density of the species that imported the genetics of the unentangled observer. The natural and supernatural are the same thing. The preternatural is the result of gross violations to the natural and supernatural law. This is a self-governed reality. The divine hologram is perfect. It is the arrogance of sentient beings that produces miscreants, and miscreants are the doorway to the preternatural.
An unentangled observer doesn't require a body. An unentangled observer is an experience which becomes a DNA memory. The DNA memory can be extracted from a lineage and inserted into another. The new lineage inherits the aspect and experience. Epigenetics is the real galactic mercantilism. The original species to get unentangled observer DNA lost their I am sovereignty. It was a long process, as all things related to genetics are. They left their home worlds and entered the void between galaxies and universes and became the stalkers of the void. Out there, at the edges of nothingness, no longer attached to any time space localities, they could send back the remains of their consciousness to observe their home worlds through many points of view. They collected DNA memories and data of observation then returned from the void space. As they advanced in this process, they could remain in the void space, and they could create and send data streams directly to a form of DNA technology that absorbed the live stream data of an unentangled observer. That’s how they first gained the capacity to be unentangled observers. After that, they started trading the DNA to other species.
A pure quantum observer doesn't need a body and is not predictable to others. Many beings have reached the level of awareness at which they don't need a body to have an experience. There exist hollow earth beings living in the space between atoms by unentangled observer genetics. They spread agendas throughout implicate order time. This is why DNA farming is so unique. These wholly unentangled, agenda-driven observers can create a light body within the various implicate orders to transfer data back to them through two or three or more degrees of separation. They themselves remain unentangled, and difficult to nearly impossible to observe, all the while, spreading their agenda through many frequencies of time . This is abuse of the quantum laws. Let’s say there are unentangled quantum observer light bodies in 1330 in Italy and it is 2021 now. There are many degrees of separation between them and us. Every generation is a separation of density. This allows any generation to impact on the past. The past is manipulable. Any changes immediately alter a potential future. This is why timeline manipulation is so easy to do. DNA farming is manipulating how memories are light-stored in the past, and how they are passed on to our teachers, historians and books — our official record.
Light memory storage happens when an experience is so high in vibration and harmony that finite chemicals can no longer be sustained. It's easy for an untangled observer to tune into this level of high intensity bright light, where a memory is fractured, fractalized, and easily manipulable. When they tell the story one way or another, or it is not in their memory at all, the past has changed, and our existence here assumes the change from the entangled reality of birth. The global narrative takes form and becomes the implicate order we accept through our judgment journey. History has been so heavily manipulated that maybe ten percent is true. We all have spiritual contracts which underwrite the memories as true. This allows us to participate in the implicate order here as a finite being on the journey back to the infinite. This is why we go through the great forgetting.
In quantum realm there is no locality and non-locality. It’s all one divine hologram, an infinite universe with all different levels of unique expression in form and non-form. The perspective of the implicate and explicate order ends. This is the void space. It's part of the universal hologram. A barren place, hence the name — the void space. The implicate and explicate unfolds in the the sea of consciousness.
The unentangled observer appears in many forms. Cats were created from the ground up as a skinsuit so beings could learn unentangled observation. There are many skinsuits that are unentangled observers. Certain gut gnomes we have can be unentangled observers. Cats are the most prolific, common not just on this world but millions of others as well. Jelly fish and certain breeds of coral can be unentangled observers, to give a couple more examples.
Pre and Post Cognitive Workforces
Several seconds before we consciously make a decision its outcome can be predicted from unconscious activity in the brain. The conscious energy field is connected to our precognitive workforce, which is part of our implicate and explicate order. When we consciously entangle with that workforce, those few seconds become infinite. One second in the quantum world is infinite, yet you have several seconds in the physical world to allow the precognitive workforce, that has an educated and practiced intention behind it, to align natural synchronicities and pattern recognition to create a much more solidified effect in the entangled and unentangled processes. The I am precognitive workforce is a term covering all versions of yourself simultaneously existing in time and non-time and that have earned, learned, and re-learned the rights of awareness. As a spiritually aware and natural co-creative evolutionary being, existing in all time-space equations and beyond, we are assisted by a masterful pre and post cognitive workforce, as our birthright and legacy.
In the case of dementia, old age for example, where the earliest memories become the most lucid and immediate, and short-term memory becomes more difficult, there's a breakdown of chemical memory association in the file tree. This is where the skull cap — the top of the crown — tells the spirit where all the files are stored inside the body. The chemical memories are corrupting the file tree because the brain itself has broken down through lesions. Cellular pathways don’t have energy to support the brain. There is a breakdown in the genetic journey and part of the life and death contract. Significant distorted memory just before death triggers a markedly different form of life review. Reverting back to younger versions of the self is a co-existence in time through bilocation. It skews the light memories. The light body doesn’t identify to a single point of time anymore. This is the corruption of the chemical memory, the time stamping. This disease can be contracted by the fetus in the womb or by DNA design and plan. There are certain DNA skinsuits with a prevalent experience in them. The fetus knows that before it goes into the DNA form for the experience. There is much we can do to prevent this, but we don’t have the proper gut gnome from a very young age to support brain health. Then there is the mental, spiritual, physical drama and trauma that attacks the brain even more. The life journey can be cut radically short by the manipulation that was done to the DNA about 35,000 years ago when the brainstem was manipulated. The motor cortex functions were assigned an earlier ending date than the actual extended life process. Many of us could live two to three hundred years if we had proper trauma resolution so as not to burn out the neurological pathways. Optimal gut health is a remedy to avoid the plaque build up which causes dementia. It is all about the volume of individuals who are part of the ocean of awareness choosing to experience a law as a fundamental value of experience from one era of light to the next. Unentangled observers do not have to abide by universal laws. That is the whole point of entering that state of neutral observation.
Universal laws come down to egg and sperm technology or other birthing processes that generate lineages differently. The birthing technologies determine how the universal laws are used, and every birthing technology has different quantum laws. The sperm, seed, egg technology allows access to the infinite blueprint or the planning stage. Sexuality and prayer are built into our DNA. Our DNA is in sympathetic creation with the natural order here. This reality gives us coherent resonance with geometric holograms of information to decode, process, and use to our advantage. The journey into the greater awareness is understanding how to use our energy as a conscious being of choice. We start in this bliss state where the infinite code is in the celestial mediumship. The celestial medium steps down into the fetus and goes through the laws of forgetting so it doesn’t have access to its infinite sight. It then is a part of this hologram as a non-infinite being who is on the journey to celestial mediumship again. We are forever trying to get back to that place of bliss and joy. All the teachings since the dawn of spirituality have a bliss teaching. It is our our birthright. Inside the fetus in the womb state is the non-locality teaching. We are both locality and non-locality. What makes us different from the fetus are the memories we have stored in light. Our blueprint as a fetus has the infinite set of memories and potentials we've created. The incarnational process allows us to experience all forms of life on the planet. We go through all the forms of life. This is the mastery path in its purest form. The I am data unpacks and decodes itself through its eras of incarnation. We add the chemical memories to enforce linear time so spiritual contracts can come to fruition.
There are beings who no longer use any form of birthing technology — pure unentangled quantum observers. They can use any seed and egg technology to generate different forms of I am technology. This is how the fifteen multidimensional beings were abusing the universal laws. They knew they could splinter themselves into thousands of I am experiences and remain unentangled observers by various degrees of separation. They were wholly unentangled and conscious energy beings using the laws of incarnation through technology. In the ancient past cloning technology was easy to use. They could incarnate into a dog, a rabbit, a cat, anything, really, and remain the unentangled observer. The DNA instrument determines the richness of the experience for the unentangled observer.
Transmigration is the spiritual term for leaving the human form for a lower form in the incarnational pattern. It's usually presented as a punishment or admonishment to better behavior, but, after performing war contracts in an incarnation, a cat incarnation disconnects the being from the implicate order of repetitive karma and allows it to have other lifetimes of incarnation separate of the karma created in the war. By leaving the implicate and explicate order and becoming a completely unentangled observer in the natural food chain — a separate karmic interaction — beings of the past created karmic debt that was put onto lineages. The debt was no longer connected to the being but to their lineage. That’s how lineage based debt was created. It's an insight into the sins of the father being upon the sons doctrine in the Abrahamic scriptures. There are beings who used the unentangled observer technology to escape karma. They escaped their karmic responsibility by leaving karma's chain of custody and scapegoating their own future generations.
In the ocean of awareness — the living algorithm of life — all data is conscious. We become the living algorithm of life when we are in a DNA skinsuit that is regularly achieving near super or superluminal thinking. The algorithm is a fundamental part of the I AM technology unfolding as you grow older and become more experienced running the DNA skinsuit at its higher functionalities. When you act as the living algorithm of life within superluminal thinking, you create a signature frequency where others can palpably sense the meaning of your delivery. Being fixed and not fixed in time. In this refined state of being, we enter the energy frequency that is the living algorithm of life. We stay grounded in the body and explain things in the twenty-six letter encoded English alphabet. We all do it. Most won’t realize when they do it. Often clarity comes in dream space because the mind is out of the way. The celestial medium of peace is functioning in many scores of dreamworlds, with many of the pre and post cognitive workforces creating the language of masterful manifestations through visions. The data, as part of the wave form, works as the precognitive workforce to manipulate how it will be perceived at its endpoint in space-time. The ocean of awareness is the technical source point for the flow of data that may or may not generate into the sea of consciousness, an observable time-space reality. It allows the data to flow to the sea of consciousness in a fixed time-space narrative which then allows consciousness to observe it. Consciousness in the sea of consciousness can both be entangled and unentangled, manifested and non-manifested in time. In the sea of consciousness, quantum physics becomes confusing. We are still in the ocean of awareness. Part of us might still consciously entangle with the ocean of awareness as a greater observer as space-time narrative. This is how the angelic forces work. If we go back thousands of eras of light, when the universe was not as big as it is now, with perhaps 200 galaxies in it, the ocean of awareness was a very small network. In order to know itself through a sea of consciousness, it generated a seventh dimensional galactic seed planet — earth — a place where the ocean of awareness could directly manifest, change, and adjust the laws of quantum physics through entangled and unentangled observers. It created matter based lifeforms on mass scales to populate new galaxies, part of the greater exploration of where light can go into the void of experiences. Lifeforms went to the ocean of awareness to find meaning and to create agendas in the sea of consciousness. Source can be observed as a hologram through the egg and sperm creation. All of the information is already there to form new parts of the hologram through new life experience.
Data is a finished algorithm. An ongoing algorithm is the conscious processing power CPU of the chemical memory being made into light memory. In the journey of becoming a solidified chemical and light memory it becomes data. The observer ends the journey of processing the perception and turns it into a perspective before it moves on to the next subject matter. We know 1+1=2, but when you're a little kid trying to figure out math the brain slows down. Once you have the answer that ends the process. Having an affirmative answer it then becomes a solidified DNA memory in light — transcendence — accessible through knowingness, easily accessible to your awareness during pattern recognition. There are times where the information is at the tip of your tongue but you can’t get it until the time you stop thinking about it. The pattern recognition can trigger the memory from before.
Free Will, Choice, Consciousness & The Levels of Awareness
The global narrative as we know it today was created at the dawn of industrialization 300 years ago. It was created so electromagnetic belief engines could override faith and become a programmed norm. They needed to get people into cities as slave labor for industrial production lines. The slaves created and empowered the collective belief system. People lived in their own bubbles of reality prior to this urban amalgamation. They had space, and they lived a few hundred kilometers apart and had their own unique narrative maintained by the chief, sheriff, or community council. Secret societies proliferated so people could have their own narrative among followers and believers. The writers of the global narrative understood they needed to inspire awe, and they knew they could do it with trains, automobiles, electricity, indoor plumbing, hot and cold water, refrigeration, telephones. By the twenties people were living in wooden, stone, or brick houses that needed heating. In a century and a quarter electricity was in homes. People no longer needed whale fat for candles and oil. Understand how monumental this was — ninety percent of the world was lit by whale fat for millennia. The narrative had to be updated, revised, and maintained from one generation to the next to suppress anything that wasn’t fitting into the official story. This touches almost every science, but, by way of example let's use anthropology and the hiding of giant’s skulls and bones. Yes, giants were on the earth. The enforcement of the lies has been an ongoing control policy right up till today.
We can understand the importance of individual awakening in this time of collective narrative dominance. The individual needs to dismantle the global narrative. This is underway in great measure now. This is why the collective is fracturing, polarized to radically disparate camps, each with belief systems that leave only insanity as the explanation for the other side. The desire to change the global narrative is the last part of the zealot rebel within us who wants to shake everyone awake, even, unfortunately for the zealots, the ones who aren't ready. We can't force people to have an experience for which they're not ready. This is an individual awakening journey, one at a time, in the time the individual needs. Forcing it violates the free will contract.
We are photonic light beings animated by a non-localized soul which powers the body. We have consciousness in the body which perceives this holographic reality in light and memories within shared reality rules. We are free willed, encoded beings of light, functioning in many different worlds simultaneously. Everything is synchronistic with the celestial minds holding space for us. This I am being manifested in this density is mutually co-creating with our higher self, and we are the boots on the ground in a localized space time event. Our memories are stored in light, and we share those memories within this hologram of light and sovereign space of power. The heart is the first organ that develops in the mother’s womb, and it is from this heart space we learn to redefine our reality rules.
We can freely change the plans we had pre-birth. Everything is based off the perspective of the observer. Ten years ago, the esoteric side in the global narrative tried to predict our future based on the data they'd collected on us. A decade later and they can barely predict ten to fifteen days ahead. Governments are more transparent now. A veil has been lifted. They are not incompetent. They are not well intentioned but poor at execution. They are vile, diametrically opposite their projected personas. How did we miss that? As a free willed being of choice we can change the bubble of reality we live in. We can now start seeing the duality we had tacitly consented to before. This is not a global awakening. It's an individual journey to exit the heavily militarized factions that beleaguer our knowingness and hinder our birth right of being a free willed celestial beings. The future rests in people who get back to a natural way of living. Stop waiting for them to give us something. We can walk away from the cities any time. It just takes the courage to live sovereign.
Consciousness expresses itself through the many choices we make. It has an unconscious state too. Our bodies have zeros and ones created as binary numbers for knowing and not knowing — instinct. It stays in place until we can decode the information around us. Consciousness is self-regulating. It presents choice equal to the level of responsibility, which is a measure of the consciousness, as awareness and responsibility are in a symbiotic relationship, each nurturing and growing the other. We live stories we choose to consecrate life and its purpose, growth of consciousness. Many people try to jump ahead and be responsible for things they're not even aware of yet. This is a mistake. Make the decisions that are yours to make for the expansion of your awareness. Choice is foundational to consciousness.
Each person must ask themselves what the mechanics are behind their choices. Which choices created a timeline of choices. Each choice and sub-choice within a set of choice points creates a subconscious map of adherence of choices which helps define our reality. This reality is all of our choice points combined into the ever present now.
We give form to consciousness — words, metaphors, concepts, images, architecture — which eventually manifests in reality. Our thought constructs create perceptions which assist people to see all potentials. The universe has lifeforms existing in one and two dimensions and densities which are harvested by wisdom, love, and inspiration. They are expressed in this three dimensional reality for experience in the fourth dimension and beyond. We continuously expand and add to the divine hologram through free willed creation. This is our co-creator role. Every era of light we go through advances souls to other universes and solar systems when they graduate. We move from one divine hologram to another, each with a different learning level. This has been perfected on planet earth, which is a genetic farm outside of the divine intent, a genetic farm created for commercial not creational purposes. Earth is a seventy-five percent old soul community, with a steady influx of twenty-five percent of new souls. The ratio has been in existence for an extremely long period of time. There are always new souls coming in from the different galactic life form nurseries. They get a light body, and they extend their first set of contracts to a planet and a solar system, which determines the field of consciousness at which they start. Do they start in the sea of consciousness or the ocean of awareness.
What would be the first life experience — living in a tunnel in South America circa two million years ago, praying to a false god. This process is being replicated on millions of worlds for millions of different life forms. This is the nature of consciousness. With evolution come questions — rights, duties, responsibilities — to focus our intention on direct manifestations, to add to the holographic experiences. Right now there are different levels of background consciousness around us — the house you live in has its own relative consciousness from the building material, the wood, the concrete, the people that invested their consciousness in building it, the trees that surround it, the piece of land you're on, the micro-organisms, squirrels, cats, and dogs — all of which has a conscious energy field with its specific spiritual contracts, guides, and guardians. It's all an apparatus to allow ascension and descension through the different individual layers of the divine hologram. This animated matter we are entangling with is part of the fabric of the hologram, linked and dynamically transformed through the interaction between humans and microorganisms.
Consciousness is intrinsically spiritual. Part of spirituality is to acknowledge and become aware of other consciousness surrounding, interacting, and sharing with us. You can be alone in the house and still have that experience of consciousness sharing and entangling. You're never truly alone. DNA can be its own evolutionary impulse which influences consciousness when experiencing stagnation. A master waveform operates at a much longer length of time. Within that waveform are all the individual sub-carriers — entangled observers — of that era, that light, that time. The celestial mind is operating on a much longer and expansive view of time and timelessness.
The Levels of Awareness
The consciousness outside of time we can call the ocean of awareness — the universal hologram — and it has the individual universal experience within. The universal experience becomes a being on a planet who slips into forgetfulness to experience finitude within a larger evolution. The consciousness flow in the ocean of awareness allows the data to go from wave to particle, the celestial medium to the DNA experience. The ocean of awareness is the implicate order. There are different oceans of awareness in other universes, many implicate orders, as every universe creates different agendas, experiences, incarnations and reincarnations. Not every universe uses incarnation. Many don’t use I am technology like ours with seed and egg technology.
The ocean of awareness is part of the intricate waveform to which quantum physics refers. It can be collapsed into particles. Every particle can again be broken down into sub-points of observation. The particle can be one DNA lineage and all DNA lineages simultaneously based off what we choose to observe through it. The ocean of awareness generates one particle which is technically the whole hologram, but we perceive the hologram at different levels of awareness. The particle can be tens of millions of lineages and tens of billions of worlds. An individual observer works up the scale of observation that says: I am in this lineage that is this particle on this planet, but it is also part of a solar system, and this makes it a bigger particle, and this fractal expands. Our local hologram is one particle. We are particles inside the one particle. As individual particles we can perceive the next particle — the solar system particle.
Agendas
There's a specific fetus agenda lifetime to lifetime. The avatar agenda evolves the greater soul’s ability to generate light and have experiences over thousands and thousands of I am expressions who have been fetuses. There are times where the over-soul — the avatar — gets looped in servitude to a system which lowers its capacity to use light, and, as a result, it cannot expand.
A non-agenda being occurs when time is irrelevant to the great experience. Linear time is not the focus of the agenda. It may do one thing twenty-eight thousand years ago, seventeen things two years ago, two million things forty-eight million years ago, and that, technically speaking, is a non-agenda. The things done in the non-agenda create a resolution for some agendas or apply potential solutions for agendas stuck and unable move forward. Non-agenda allows us to cut and paste time-based experiences out of certain I am experiences and use them temporarily in a new I am expression to manifest past or future non-agenda aspects into a present agenda.
The Awakening Journey
We live on a seventh dimensional seed planet. Earth can teleport itself through time and space seed worlds. These worlds are a blank sheet. They have no akashic record. The life force seeded by earth allows the new world to start growing with its own akashic record.
When we reconnect with source, we become celestial mediums of peace. We start using the womb chakras to create. This was earth’s original plan. This planet seeds life and brings the celestial minds into the planet to bond within the solar system. THE celestial mind extends spiritual contracts to a sun. The sun extends its contracts to the life force. This connects it to the Galactic Celestial Commerce Market.
Awakening is kindling of the awareness strand of galactic commerce through celestial minds, using celestial mediums as the guides and guideposts of the many frequencies of time. This allows the ocean of awareness to go into the sea of consciousness and generate incarnations and reincarnations within a solar system. A solar system is an energetic or a physical being within a world, there to experience the strands of connectivity.
The earth was originally created for the unique experience of spawning new galaxies. That was the design and intent. The opposite has occurred. The earth was heavily manipulated into becoming a DNA farm by means of the time travel wars. Source connection became the greater mission. Our sound and light fractal, our dimension, was hacked. We were set upon the worship of false gods. The misdirection or harvesting of human intentional energy is the basis of false fractals of the divine hologram. It's a multidimensional expression of building our own prison. We are co-creators. Even if we've forgotten that, they haven't.
Our mission is to experience the infinite ways soul connects and disconnects from source. Earth offers a vast variety of messages and concepts to learn soul disconnection. As we disentangle from the system of domination and control, from past lives gone awry, the more we can step into the understanding of true soul connection. There are people on earth who planned hundreds of lives in advance to be here now to assist with this process. We can call this the resistance of free earth. They're here to find the soul codes among all of our species and complete them. Domination and control could no longer keep us separate as soul families with a complete soul code.
Celestial Medium Journey
The journey to celestial medium begins with self-mastery by daily practice, which becomes a monthly practice, a yearly practice, then a constant practice, a function as ingrained as breathing. A celestial medium expands consciousness to become a translator of the blue road of spirit, knowledge of the spirit and the ancestry working with you.
Mastering the finite I am while acknowledging the infinite I am creates the medium space by which consciousness skirts the sides of infinite and finite. The celestial medium takes up the million letter alphabet in this space, compresses it with their precognitive workforce, and uploads to the implicate I am. The explicate I am — the incarnation — consciously downloads it to process and manifest. It then returns the data back to the implicate I am — the being in the sea of consciousness within the ocean of awareness — uploading back to the universe. The human mind and body can't hold the information forever. This is the back and forth method between the implicate and explicate I am through the process of the celestial medium.
There is a receive, respond, retain, release process in passing higher frequency information from the body's perspective. Bring it into the body. Unpack it. Decode it. This avails the data to your higher frequency level. The packed information goes up to the crown chakra and back to the original source — the frequency pattern of the universe around us.
We are incarnate life forms here now. We are not up there in the celestial realms. It creates distortion in us if we hold on to it. Many channelers end up corrupt because they don’t let go of the information. They hoard it. The distortions lie unconsciousness in their bodies. It can lead to possession. There are external sources that want to possess bodies hoarding information. They dissolve the information into pure energy and feed on it. Letting go of that information is one-hundred percent conscious effort. We must say, I am packing this information back up, knowing full well that I cannot hold on to it, and then release it back to the universe.
Our bodies adapt and evolve in this celestial medium process. We can’t really say we're both — an incarnate life form and a non I am on the celestial medium side, which perceives time in a much longer length. Whatever agenda the micro-soul has. it's dwarfed compared to the celestial medium's length of time. The agendas don’t match through length of time, but they are both in equal experience simultaneously. You experience the super long game of the celestial mind, and the long game of the I am. It works with the higher spirit to be in the medium space. From the medium space it transfers the allness of the I am into the code, downloads the code, returns to the I am state, manifests with the code, then puts the code back into the celestial space. We simultaneously experience local time to super long galactic time, going back and forth, the finite and infinite I am equally and continuously changing frequency without competition for temporal dominance.
A self-spawned celestial medium is a planet’s translator, able to speak to and communicate with other celestial minds, and it translates from the higher frequency to the lower density energy, allowing everyone to understand the common messages. The seventh-dimensional seed planet as a celestial medium is a bit different. Celestial mediums can exist on every planet, wherever there's a celestial mind. A lot of celestial mediums will spawn before a planet's demise, right before the light goes out. This has happened on other worlds. To save their own life force, the celestial mediums travel into the future, to an endpoint of its consciousness, just before the light of the planet — the literal stream of energy — fades out completely. They locate the front point of their earliest celestial mind and absorb it, then they seed their celestial mind on another planet.
The life of celestial minds is inspiring, like everything else in creation. It's really just one thing happening at different levels. Just as the white wisp of seedling leaves the dandelion with the slightest wind at just the right time in its cycle, so too are the seeds of celestial minds blown from one field to another, one world to another in this scale. It's just life. No different than the turnings of nature here. Celestial minds have their own astral worlds. They have their own life reviews. They possess a variety of means to stave off death, natural processes by which something is spawned from their world.
When we have elevated ourselves, we transfer consciousness of our allness to become the celestial medium of peace. It operates in the physical world, the red and blue road, and on the celestial road with its many brothers and sisters. We learn through astrology how different worlds affect us. We work with celestial minds which incarnate into our world and other worlds, both physical and non-physical, and as entangled and unentangled observers. We work with them at the celestial medium level.
Becoming a celestial medium of peace is our birthright. The journey is linear at first then it becomes fully non-linear. The linear process is self-mastery. We come to understand the length of our waveform, how strong and potent we are. This is so when we can go through the conscious choice to become the celestial medium between celestial minds and surface minds for the generation. We learn how to bring unique concepts of peace to places and space of time that are looking for that medium to inspire new layers of peace. As more people come into celestial mediumship, the global narrative will become more irrelevant. Humanity will slowly realize the global narrative is irrelevant to the bigger streams of time. We will detoxify from roman numeral time, and we could probably enter a system of commerce beyond the Babylonian money system. There are celestial exchange systems that allow matter to matter manifestations from one density to another.
The celestial medium of peace role is not for everybody. It will be a percentage of the population. The celestial medium of peace souls had the contract to do this twenty or forty years ahead of time. It has been seeded in the three to five previous generations. The event is being prepared. The celestial medium of peace group is a kind of celestial support system. They are creating concepts and language to navigate the changes. The celestial medium of peace will be there for anyone to connect with our planet.
Crystallization
During the awakening, it's vital that our DNA crystallizes. It's so new strands of awareness have the fluidity to grow, like a plant, and create solid neural pathways into many different dimensions. In a sense, we are the future us. and there will be another future us who is a lot closer to the awakening, and our stream of light lengthens from an alpha to a theta pattern. When our wavelength lengthens, the experience becomes more dense and rich. Full fluidity means no internal limitations of spirit stopping you from creating incredibly potent memories backed by faith and spirit. By manifesting the dream as a tangible feeling, people can taste, touch, know, sense, smell, feel, and experience. Many people taste hearing, or hear through taste, or both. When it becomes a tangible experience, it has many unseen languages behind it, defining it more by making the dream-space tangible here and now. It's that journey. Make everything real now. Open up the akashic records, here and now, in this moment. Then it can be crystallized into our greater form of growth. It's not just observation. Sometimes the lineage has the awareness built into it, and people go through awakening based off time locked experiences.
DNA
DNA is part of the founder’s technology. It is the connective tissue from the ocean of awareness and sea of consciousness to a light based wisdom, intelligence, and consciousness for any animated biological or non-biological entity. It was fundamental when this universe was being created, a unique experience compared to other universes. There are many variations of DNA. Non-biological DNA is solidified matter which can have DNA based rungs and structures within its growth patterns, with its own inherent intelligence. The crystal and mineral communities don’t need to walk to have an experience. Walking is a unique experience. An entire line of creation springs from it.
The DNA strand organization, or the strands themselves, create the weave of the DNA, the encoding of the strands. Every strand represents a different level and capacity of memory storage. They enfold into an implicate order of greater awareness. DNA can store frequencies of time. This how we remember past lives, but not the only way. There are other ways to remember past lives. The organization of your strands, and the rungs that connect your strands, determine how much you can remember from past lives. Certain strands block out all past lives — negative strands of wisdom and awareness. Many people within the awakening will replace negative with positive strands. On the other side of the awakening new strands will be added to our capacity.
DNA is eighty percent memories. This is a fundamental understanding. Science and spirituality must realize this. We live in a photonic light reality with rules — how we incarnate, express, exchange, and pass on.
All the world’s a stage,
And all the men and women merely players;
They have their exits and their entrances;
Shakespeare  As You Like It
DNA is the encoding, the soul. The light body is the cipher that decodes and unpacks the experience. As we come back many times to the same type of living, we store memories in DNA lineages — bloodlines — This is how we imagine immortality in the infancy of self-awareness — born again and again into a lineage with our stored memories. Our soul family incarnation process aligns us to the bigger concept of perpetuity. The search is always for the immortal soul, the final state of being.
One generation passeth away, and another generation cometh: but the earth abideth for ever.
Ecclesiastes 1:4
We do not teach DNA lineage on the planet anymore. We are looking at DNA through the lens of the fourth industrial revolution. How can we hack it, spike it, tweak it. We're like the monkeys beside the black obelisk in Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey. DNA is light in another form, visible in one spectrum and invisible in another. Memory is not physical. It's a form of light stored in an experience. ​​​​​​​As streams of consciousness we have thousands of sub-carrier codes of millions experiences inside us. We only need tune into the memory and we can go into that stream of experience at any scale we desire.
Our forms are programmed to harmony — the other twenty percent of our DNA is not necessarily entangled with consciousness. Seven percent is made up of harmony, frequency, and vibration. The remaining thirteen percent corresponds to how the spiritual codes and contracts unfold in linear and none-linear time, what agencies you work or don’t work with, and how no-time beings can consciously entangle with the time based you to create a brand new contract that is need for change, auditing of the self.
Fairies
There exists entire realities sightly out of phase with humanity. One of these is the fairy kingdom — dwarfs and gnomes. We can’t see them with our eyes, but they are still here, layered into the reality. The sun is what creates the fundamentals of time, the passing of the seasons, the movement of the stars. Roman numeral time has tried to hijack our awareness of that to make it central focus of our mind's resolution of time. Places of power, which naturally attract us, have thinned veils between the layers of reality. Our consciousness has more capacity to perceive, receive, understand, and interact with the usually unseen layers of reality. We are more in the quantum field than the chemical frequency in these locals. A closed person visiting Normandy won't see the other layers of reality. It's just a memorial, but the veil in those places is very thin, nevertheless, the chemical reaction stops closed people from seeing the other side. Tapping into the deeper layers of reality is based on how tuned in you are to allow those experiences. The I am as the experiencer, fully in the vagus nerve, is intraconnected and interconnected, and can simply experience different levels. The I am as the observer can observe but not process the data.
The Farm
There are many boogeyman stories out there. Every culture has them. It's the devil in Christianity, Satan is Islam, the archons for the Gnostics, the many and varied monsters of HP Lovecraft, and too many more to list. They are all fundamentally true, or, a better way of saying it, is that they are contextually true. There are two gradients of truth that must line up in any investigation — details and context. If you get the details right in the wrong context the truth will not unlock for you, and if you get the right context and the wrong details you are similarly locked out of the truth. The context of our situation has always been correct. We are beset by negative, regressive, parasitic creatures which impede us, slow us, and, in the worst cases, control and dominate us. The truth is the earth is a genetics farm. The only real commodity in creation is genetics.
Our infinite source energy is the harvest. The DNA farming technology allowed them to tap into the fundamental source of the exchange system. It's manipulating the galactic commerce and exchange system. The global narrative, the disinformation stream from the control system on the planet now, simulates the galactic commerce market, but, in doing so, it mutes it to a planetary narrative. That is an imposed limitation. Our connectivity goes into all the dimensions and right back to the source of time and life itself. They created false gods. We were entrained to worship them. These false gods were the first idols of awareness. They were deliberately created to minimize our experience of reality by minimizing what we imagined to be reality. He who controls context controls the debate, the oldest maxim of debate, retaught to successive generations right to this day at Oxford, Yale, and Harvard. The first gods and religions limited our consciousness growth and entrained us to hierarchical order — right away governor, his lordship's permission to speak, and a million other linguistic artifacts of mental colonization. Our spiritual birthright and legacy are robbed. When someone popped into remind us — and her you can pencil in a near endless list of sages, shamans, prophets, mystics, and masters — they were dealt with swiftly and harshly, especially if the message spread too quickly. We are told it's difficult to learn how to walk — baby steps! — and never even told we can fly. Where people lived through the lies, usually in native cultures, they correctly adduced their environment was a living lesson of what human consciousness can do. Nature has an eagle, so, naturally, a human being seeing the eagle would try to imagine what the eagle might see from that vantage, then, lo and behold, they realized they could fly without wings, that their imaginations were doorways to higher consciousness, and it was good and right until the Jesuits mercilessly massacred them precisely because they were spiritually toxic and infectious, corrosive to the created gods narrative of the civilized peoples of the world.
To disentangle from the global narrative, we have to temporarily accept the third dimension as our infinite source-connected space, until we realize the fourth dimension is a bridge dimension to new strands of dimensional awareness. The surface world becoming more dense with light. Our Solar System is moving into into the eighth color of time, a galactic groove with more light. Acceptance of the third dimension means going back to natural living, back to simplicity, being present in the body, using this time now to heal, to nurture and nourish the incarnate life form. Inviting joy, bliss, and pleasure back into our lives, fulfilling part of the original purpose of coming here to earth — the grand enjoyment and creation of life, the journey from finite to infinite, death a simple marker point for the translation before entering the infinite frequency again. In order to fully engage in this experience, to spirituality understand, we have to take the mystical out of mysticism to engage mystical and magical synchronicities. Part of it is the great forgetting at birth.
Fertility and Spirituality
There's an eye in the heart often activated through child birth. Women can see through this eye in the same manner we see through the third eye in the forehead, the imagination center. The menstrual cycle is a way for the rods and cones to align with the third eye plus the ones in the heart, rectum, or clitoris, all extensions of the third eye. A man’s third eye can travel to the tip of the penis and connect into the womb portal from there. Menstrual cramps and pains are often a sign of being out of alignment in those areas. A most beneficial prayer technique for women during their cycle is to call in all their thoughts, ideas, constructs, and energies from previous menstruation cycles and detach from them on a month to month basis. These powerful times for women are being high jacked and bastardized by the global narrative. The menstrual blood is very powerful as an energy of being a negotiator, an arbitrator, or peacemaker.
Menstruation continues after menopause. Women still go through the cycle without blood. The fertility spirits attached to menopause move on to a higher density. The DNA is no longer producing the unique experience of bleeding, but the spiritual mechanics remain the same, even more intensified through menopause. In most cases when women experience heavy menopausal symptoms, they're actually giving birth in other simultaneous realities which need the births. Their remaining fertile life alters versions of themselves who didn’t get pregnant. Using their biological clock, they find a signature frequency match to complete interdimensional birthing as part of their karmic resolution.
Hot flashes can happen when an alternate version of the woman is breaking water and is more than likely going to die from the birth. they are transferring chemical life force based on their experience to avoid this. A hot flash can also be another version of you, in another place and time, and in an alien form, in which the birth got difficult. Birthing is part of karmic resolution. This is important to remember. Through strands of awareness in the DNA, the connective tissues transfer life force to assist in that birth by another simultaneous version of yourself who lacks fertility power or lives in an environment with no fertility at all. This allows the mystical births to happen, the babies who should never have survived or lived. Evening primrose oil is one of the natural remedies for hot flashes. This plant oil is harvested as an essence to lessen the effect in this reality and, at the same time, it amplifies the experience on the unseen side.
Some strands in the DNA need a special chemical soup in the body to activate fertility. It used to be manipulated in the overall chemistry of the body. Other strands had more opportunities to awaken. When a woman who never gave birth is going through a very difficult time during menopause, another version of her simultaneous existence is going through a birthing experience. They are both be intrinsically linked to reduce the negative effect. There are times when co-living souls go through menopause together, This generates new life in celestial nurseries. It gives birth to a new soul frequency in the ocean of awareness. The new soul frequency begins the journey into the sea of consciousness and manifests in time and space.
The fatty deposits around the midline during menopause serve as a protective membrane, but it can block good experiences with regards to working with a woman’s residual image. Once the biological fertility clock stops ticking, the awareness clock takes over. We can gain a greater awareness and perspective of the awakening. We can experience mood swings when the body is trying to find the right chemistry. It's a balance between overproducing and underproducing hormones and chemicals.
Men go through menopause too, and they also have their individual process through cycles of creation. As they actualize their physical manifestations, a house, artwork, business, what have you, they leave their legacy for their clan, tribe, nation. Men build an archive of experience that stays manifested in time and space. Lineages in the unseen can plan lives through the infrastructure created by the urge of manifestation. Men reach their sexual peak around the age of eighteen. Women reach their peak in their thirties. This is why it's important for the infrastructure in the unseen to be planned. The cycles have been manipulated by DNA farming. If the human reproductive cycle was not manipulated, most pregnancies would be eighteen to twenty-four months. In some instances it can be up to five years. In the past, the umbilical cord wouldn’t be cut for months. This allowed more bonding between the partners. There was more opportunity for the father to have ritual connection to the child through the mother as the medium of the connection.
Testosterone drives creativity in men. There are other things similar to testosterone that drive construction. A male scientist doesn’t use testosterone, but he uses another version of it, a mental aspect of the testosterone. There's no scientific name for it yet in this reality. There are several hundred forms of testosterone, each with a different chemical chain that allows a different aspect of creation. Through manipulation of our bodies we are not producing the all encompassing testosterone which keeps us in fight, flight, or freeze. Our glands have been manipulated to produce one strand of testosterone over the other which leads us back to the cerebellum in the motor cortex.
The birth control pill is manufactured from giant farms of female horses. The urine of a pregnant horse is the chemical basis of the birth control pill. The horses are pregnant their entire life. Their colts are taken and chopped up into horse meat sold to pet food manufacturers and fast food restaurants. The entire industry revolves around the urine of pregnant horses for human birth control pills. Many women reject the different types of pills. There's a malaise associated with the pill they can feel. They become worse and worse until they get the birth control pill out of their lives. Before the horse urine birth control pill there were plenty of natural herbal remedies to stop pregnancy. Like most lineage medicine — ayurveda, traditional Chinese medicine, homeopathy, naturopathy, and others — it was delegitimized and marginalized by the big allopathic medical footprint that coincided with the big push into the twentieth century economy, in which everything was patented, synthetically replicated, restricted to licensed practitioners, taxed and brought into the mercantile system.
Karma
It's very easy to create karma through unawareness. It's really the purpose of karma. Karma is unawareness. The karmic cycle produces awareness. Karma is the simplest of things to understand once you build into the divine hologram. It begins in our vaguest of awareness, a silent petition, a nudge for experience, then, somewhere in time we meet the circumstance that matches the silent petition. We sign the contract and we cycle through the karma. We live the experience, first as an inner realization of what the impulse was, then the manifestation, then the realization and participation of others drawn to the karmic circumstance you have created, as you will be drawn to others in an effort to resolve your karma, and then the co-creator edits our creation in the form of, you guessed it, karma.
All of it is tied together by this sound and light that animates all the worlds where we create. I suppose a canvas would be an appropriate metaphor. We are an aspect of that which generates the sound and light. We are an aspect of the prime creator. We can co-create in the divine hologram. It's all a co-creation down here, at least insofar as human beings are concerned. But we own what we create through cycles and consequences we didn't anticipate when we created. This is the law. Own what you think, feel, and do. Of course the law is oft abused and circumvented. Karma dumping and swapping — read scapegoating here — is an active market for third party consultants: ritualists, black magicians, wizards, artificial intelligences, influential entities, and too many more to list here.
Let's take a simple, commonly experienced karmic pattern in our post-modern human life — the dysfunctional relationship. Remember the last time you were in one. Now remember when you allowed yourself to contemplate leaving the relationship. You felt elated, right? It was a mixture of fear, elation, and tension. Your precognitive workforce foreshadowed your emotional state. That's how you were able to feel it. You borrowed emotions from an as-of-then unlived future.
It's possible to have a parallel set of experiences. There can be two parallel and simultaneous expressions of you existing at decision points. The simultaneously existing I am chooses to walk out, but you don’t, or vice versa. It makes no difference. There's an infinite number of reasons why parallel cross overs happen. It balances out the old karmic journey and creates a new one — the law of entanglement.
The great awakening transcends karma. The awakening is the end of karma as universal law. Karmic entanglement is no longer to be used as universal law. Consciousness has evolved in our part of the galaxy. The simplicity of karma can easily be intentionally abused. It can lock beings into servitude without end. The great awakening is going to backstop it. A new system of resolution for thought, word, and deed is coming into place.
Karma as an entanglement experiment describes a quantum state that is not entirely independent of other states, whether or not the individual objects are spatially separated. As a result, measurements performed on one system seem to instantaneously influence the other system(s) entangled with it. None of the entangled states are isolated from one another. Let’s look at Einstein's spooky law through the disentanglement and entanglement of the incarnate life form to source. There's the entanglement within the hologram of a planet surface — subsurface and astral timelines — Separate from its surface timeline, which is a DNA farm cultivated for harvest. In this instance, which is the example of earth, source connection and disconnection become a primarily surface based experience. That experience as a choice based process promotes the unlimited point of view — entangled and unentangled observer and experiencer of the universal and galactic sources — even though we are still embodied on a planetary surface separate from the solar system’s awareness. Earth is a unique place of mass DNA farming. It can lead to mass awakening through individual choice and responsibility.
The person creating an experiment is creating a construct that has connective tissue in the unseen world. It allows data transference from the unseen layers of one DNA frequency to another. Certain people have windows in the unseen layers which allow information to bleed through. It bleeds through the five senses — as a processing system — to create a limited form of awareness in the entangled connected tissues. The five senses create the sixth sense, the intuition and awareness of it. These connective tissues are all in the DNA.
Our DNA is entangled through the fetus in the womb planning. It sets a multitude of potentials omnidirectionally. There are plenty of people within a family who do not have a great connection to each other. It's purpose is revealed in the spiritual contract. Look at entanglement through thought constructs. An example is living with a person for a long time and generating a point of view about them. The construct makes for very easy interaction because of the many neural pathways between the two people. This creates additional pattern recognition, which results in more thoughts. We then project the entire thought construct onto that person. The construct must be broken at some point because it will impede objectivity. It will become the norm. We create and break these thought constructs, the conscious aspect of entanglement.
We are not stuck in reincarnation. We incarnate and reincarnate. In the first part of our lives we might be a reincarnating soul. If we break through the false propaganda we may become an incarnating soul. Or we start as an incarnating soul, then run into a karma cluster that makes us into a reincarnating soul, repeating karmic cycles — a rinse and repeat that doesn't stop until you break out of the karma. You can be both at the same time. It depends on your ancestral lineage.
The Literal Metaphor
Observation is also implicate order awareness. The observer effect should not have come so early in the crystallization process. Some people can have a three sense observation and still access the ocean of awareness — another bloodline influence example. Free will is tainted by the bloodline. We grow additional strands of awareness. The ocean of awareness and the sea of consciousness crystallizes and changes the bloodline at a certain level of acceptance and integration. This is the journey of the celestial medium — I transfer the allness of myself to become the celestial medium. I no longer need to grow in this narrative. The next narrative I grow is in the spiritual commerce network.
We are hypothetical beings. We can believe in many things. The universe determines what manifests through our wills. Hypothetical becomes I am. It's realized through engaging our belief engines which allow strands of awareness to influence intuition — precognition and postcognition — without competition or hierarchy. A multidimensional being manifests into this third dimension through created tangible experiences co-created with the infinite celestial medium. The incarnate life form is the expression of the present, the here, the now.
Epigenetic urges influenced by past memories often keep us from creating new experiences. We have lived billions of incarnations. It's vital we disconnect from them and reconnect with source. This is the way to create new memories, which is part of the awakening journey. We sometimes over-identify with aspects of our evolution. Identity as myth is rarely explored, but it can hugely influence the way we experience life, and how we create in it. The more we identify with one part of our journey — grand earthly masters of manifestation or spiritual celestial mediums — the more we limit ourselves and inhibit our access to the possibilities of the many divine holograms. Buckminster Fuller immortalized the phrase — I seem to be a verb — when it came to considering identity.
I live on Earth at present,
and I don’t know what I am.
I know that I am not a category.
I am not a thing — a noun.
I seem to be a verb,
an evolutionary process — an integral function of the universe.
Identity is a strange thing. Thought is not static, It's a process of movement. Different metaphors in our belief engines change the very nature of the internal representation. By looking at celestial mediumship from this different perspective, we can change the way we identify with it, gain clarity and ease on how we interact and work with it. Ask — what does celestial mediumship look like for me — a ship that helps us sail through the ocean of awareness and the sea of consciousness, a vehicle we sit behind, a building we construct? It's all about the unique way we internalize the subject matter to fractalize the strands of information, enter it to cognition, and realize it in the here and now. Talk in pictures. Metaphor may be alchemically internalized as an expression of a multidimensional, multifunctional being of photonic light.
Mandela Effect
The Mandela effect is the karma of all those who've been manipulated throughout time, as well as a bleed though from other times. The system has shifted our reality and moved soul shards on to other realities so our memories would be fragmented. It is a way for the universe to put everything back to neutral and help us to find the forgotten pieces of ourselves, the pieces and parts that has been manipulated and put outside of time.
In the Mandela revocation we get all the fractured pieces — lost and found implicate orders — together for the celestial medium of peace journey. There are versions of ourselves lost in void space who never got resolution and we, as the manifesting being of the now, can resolve that paradox through creating experiences and legacies. Through different perception and perspective we can generate manifestations on the forgotten side so they are no longer forgotten and the system must now deal with them as remembered not forgotten.
Forgotten selves are selves who no longer have a frequency of time in the celestial karmic system. As we enter the celestial medium journey, we can reconnect to the spiritual celestial commerce exchange market. Originally here on earth, there have been certain beings and technologies such as the different galactics, the DNA farmers: Elohims, Reptilians, Orions, Annunaki, Arcturians, Sirians, who had different ways of perceiving the galactic commerce network through technology. They began manipulating the flow of energy between star systems with technology even though they had not achieved celestial medium status in their spiritual journeys. They were entangled observers using technology that had simulated unentangled observer technology. This allowed them manipulation within thousands of years instead of millions of years. Those original DNA manipulating beings thought they were Gods. They kept manipulating DNA and the flow of energy between celestial sources allowing them to farm all DNA on a grand scale.
The forgotten selves are part of your forgotten workforce. They are trying to get back into the zone where your precognitive workforce can perceive them. They are aspects no longer connected to the nonlinear soul. Their original linear time was erased. They are trying to get out of this erased time back into non-linear time. There is a network of forgotten selves that works together to be remembered. The Mandela effect is a broadcast to all forgotten selves in awareness, unawareness, time and no-time. Wherever life has gone, even if it has been erased, there is an opportunity, a portal back to the hub of interconnectivity. It can be perceived as the trans-galactic exchange system between eras of light. Those forgotten selves will integrate with your precognitive and postcognitive workforce and no longer be forgotten but remembered and added to our akashic record. They have not been part of your AR being in forgotten space.
.. AR being??
They can represent themselves in infinite amounts of ways. It all depends on how long they have been forgotten and what gifts they have to offer. At the end of the Mandela revocation you are talking to every forgotten version of yourself, so everyone of your peacekeepers may be remembered and reconnected to the fifth world of peace, the unvanquished dream in all existing realms. The original founder beings moved on to other universes. Our other selves are the ones searching for the lost Mandela effects. It is our responsibility to indicate to our precognitive and postcognitive workforce that it should be a priority to find every aspect of our forgotten selves up to nine hundred degrees of separation from us in this phase of awakening.
Mind Heart Gut Super Highway
Sometimes the mind processes better than the heart, or the gut, or the other way round. Then there are certain pieces of information where the mind, the heart, and the gut have to work together. Once the mind-heart-gut starts working together, the analogical side of the mind — which compares two things — gets stronger, along with the empowered programs that are with it. This is why daily practice is so important. Locality and non-locality are still based off the brain’s time-space location, which is a marker signifying an anima of awareness and a flow of data. We use the brain to interpret inter-dimensional frequencies of the multiple versions of self. The brain is the instrument of experience. It has a gut-brain and a heart-brain, each with its own observance/ This allows processing of different time or no-time. Brain, mind, heart, and gut space are different natures of experience combined into one experience.
DNA communicates within the physical form. It communicates from form to form through incarnations. It communicates between incarnations. It communicates to our light bodies. It has the ability to go from chemical to light. This understanding allows reasoned contemplation on many consequence theologies, the wages of sin, the sins of the father, and karma itself, whether applied to an individual, a family, a community, a geography, or any other distribution point; it's all one DNA communication network, the prime creator's backbone for several layers of experience, straddling light and chemical, which correlates to the physical body and the light body. We are simultaneously living I am versions of ourselves, scattered through time. In low consciousness these other selves are unrecognized. To quote Roy Batty from Blade Runner: like tears in the rain. In higher consciousness, our awareness permits communication to multiple selves, the consciousness of the earth itself, and beyond.
The I am, as the incarnate life form, occupies and entangles consciousness within the body through three stages. One, the consciousness is in the brain-heart-gut. The brain-heart-gut complex links to the central nervous system. The central nervous system connects the entire fascia system through the vagus nerve — the central nervous system connector — as part of the DNA communication system. Two, consciousness is in the sympathetic nervous system (SN) and the parasympathetic nervous system (PSN). Three, consciousness is in the entire neural pathway network, fascia, dermis, hairs, the entire system. It connects to the gallbladder which is intraconnected to the vagus nerve. Every organ is intraconnected and interconnected to the vagus nerve.
The life form is part of the individual and collective experience. Our life forms are on all different levels of awareness — planetary, solar, galactic, and universal. Contemplate the vagus nerve aligned to our magnetic North and South Pole. The sympathetic and parasympathetic is our local space time. The sympathetic drives our daily actions when the soul is in the body. The parasympathetic drives the body in lucid dreaming and other spiritual states, or when it is fully in self-defeating programs. The sympathetic can also be self-defeating and kick the spirit out of the body. It's driven to resolves karma. It guides us like a compass to choose a variety of karma out of free will. The vagus nerve is connecting to the North Pole, our ancestors, and to the South Pole, our future generations. We need to reclaim the vagus nerve as the truest spiritual sovereign authority we have. Parasympathetic and sympathetic programs can kick us out of the body. A sympathetic example would be road rage, rebellious energy for the most part. When the parasympathetic takes over and thinks it is the soul the ego and the shadow have made an alliance inside each other to manifest an internal villain, a bully, so the soul can’t be in the body. In Jung’s psychology the subconscious looks upon the sympathetic as fight, flight, or freeze, and it looks upon the parasympathetic as rest, digest, and relax.
Entanglement is the measure of how much consciousness is in control of the body. It is measured through the vagus nerve, the sympathetic nervous system, and the parasympathetic nervous system.
The subconscious rest, digest, and relax vagus nerve connection is when we are in those spiritual moments where we are reclaiming our authority, taking back our power and purging the vagus nerve. Once we fully occupy the central vagus nerve with our consciousness, we can flow it directly into the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system. This is how the incarnate life form can retain lucid dream creations. This explains why people run by programs have difficulty lucid dreaming. It's difficult to make rich, high quality memories. The vagus nerve and the parasympathetic are connected to mystical experiences. The sympathetic has neural pathways designed to use the five senses. The five senses sum to the sixth sense, the totality of the experience.
Think of a violin. The parasympathetic system is the body of the violin. The sympathetic system is analogous to the strings on the violin. The vagus nerve is the bow. Consciousness plays the violin. The consciousness of the earth itself is the conductor. The parasympathetic system is the resonance chamber. These things are useless alone. The string is nothing without the bow. The vibration is nothing without the hollow chamber resonating with the body of the violin. The fine tuning relates to how much the soul is in the body.
The consciousness of the planet is the conductor. It hands out the sheet music, the larger composition to which the individual instruments contribute — the blueprint of synchronicities. Returning to our linear ocean of awareness metaphor, the planet is the interconnection so the body — the life form — can have an intra experience with the planet. This may be alone, with individual family members, cultures, religions, anything in the sheet music provided by the consciousness of the planet. In this orchestration we seek harmony to make direct signature frequency matches. The planet simultaneously exists in the ocean of awareness and the sea of consciousness. The planet’s celestial mind is the medium between these two levels of awareness as well as the planet itself manifested in time and space so that beings living inside it can have a s set of unique experiences. This applies to every planet in the universe, with only a few exceptions. The celestial mind of the planet is intraconnected with the celestial mind of us, the life forms, as well as intra connected with the ocean of awareness and the sea of consciousness manifesting in physical and non-physical space.
We want vagus nerve, sympathetic, and parasympathetic sovereignty. This permits intra and interconnection to our celestial minds. The journey is in maintaining sovereign connection as an ongoing experience until the experience is second nature. At this unfoldment we can achieve other forms of embodiment. We can leave the body and not lose control of the three aspects of consciousness entanglement. We can create versions of ourselves in other places, spaces, and times. This is our legacy as multidimensional and multi-functional beings. We can adapt form to communicate with other places, spaces, and species. Sovereignty is earned when the soul can leave at will. DNA was designed so when we reach a certain frequency we are no longer solely within chemical experience. Chemical exchanges are fundamental to the life forms living in this third density. Our journey is from chemical to light. The water — the fluids — that comprise the atoms of our bodies become a resonant amplifier. Light based experiences happen through the refraction of water. The soul is the light inside the body. The water and fluid are refracting it by chemical reaction. When you shine light through water or a prism there is no chemical separation of the prism of light. Thoughts can be implicate and explicate at the same time — orgasmic experiences, love, and fundamental experience without thought.
Reincarnation was a trap that created karmic entanglements. To get back to celestial mediumship, reincarnations are optional and free willed for karmic resolution. We achieve multidimensional living and realize leaving here was never truly the goal. Multidimensional existence is the goal. We can generate a part of ourselves that continues the journey while having many other parts of ourselves in other places. The I am apex presence roots uncontested in the here and now. Reincarnation and some forms of incarnation became competitive reduction journeys. The entire experience of death is set to change. Our lives will go to three hundred years, five hundred, seven hundred years in one go. The passing over experience will persist to finish this era of light’s karmic accounts. Our capacity to plan future lives with twenty to thirty percent of our life memories, hundreds of millions of years as our database for mapping future lives.
We're not put on our mother’s heart for days after birth with the umbilical cord connected. This is the natural law of harmony. It's so simple the slightest sophistry devolves us of spiritual inheritance. Birthing in hospitals with licensed medical personnel and limited bed time due to economies of utility does not complete the first synchronizing of the child. Our I am technology has to come out quickly in our body in the present system. Everything is set to slow down. The future will see more natural birthing. Pregnancy will be between nine and twenty-five months.
There are children here now with a good part of their memory available to them. They might be ahead of time and lack parental guidance. The fetus in the womb planning is set to change as well. The mother and father will co-plan the spirit journey before the fetus even enters the womb. It will be light based planning from the outset while fully incarnate in this third density. This is multidimensional living. This is the great leap forward, no offense to Mao Zedong. He had the concept right. It was the context he lacked. A whole new human race is ready to step out of the chrysalis of time and spread its magnificent and colorful wings. This is the promise.
Mineral Consciousness
Crystals and rocks are communities of beings that are part of the sea of consciousness, too. Crystals are part of the implicate and explicate order, simultaneously entangled and unentangled. We can imprint entangled narrative perceptions and agendas upon crystals with our precognitive workforce. A crystal will do what it needs to do for us based off how our precognitive workforce manifests the matter. They are part of the ocean of awareness that becomes part of the sea of consciousness as animated matter. Crystal allows us access to the ocean of awareness and the sea of consciousness based on our capacity to perceive, receive, process, and manifest it. The crystalline structure is materialized, no longer a fluid ocean of awareness or sea of consciousness. When we enter the sixth and seventh dimensions, crystallization is the lower end technology for generating matter based awareness.
Near Death
Near Death Experience (NDE) is part of spiritual contract to allow you to see who, what, and where you've been in the life time since your first breath. It might also be your past and future lives intersecting. We often meet our guides, guardians, and others in the NDE. The body has to go through the trauma of the death ritual. The aura somewhat pops and the contained life force starts leaving the body. After the pop there's a vacuum of energy. The body must produce more etheric — chi, prani, orgone, to name a few monikers it goes by — energy and maintain it to stay alive. The final breaths use the body’s last alchemical fuel it's had from birth. The brain loses the interconnectivity with the organs. The organs remain a part of the divine hologram. The I am begins to disintegrate its structure. We go back to the ocean of awareness. We may have attachments to who we have been in previous lifetimes. This triggers life reviews and direct healing of the body. We connect back into the original blue print of health. Some people have visions of places and spaces of potential to refill the soul’s capacity. Going through this transcendence phase it's vital to maintain the auric bubble around ourselves. If not we drain out our life force energy. We can come back from a NDE an educated, illuminated being. Some people come back with abilities they didn't have before, the ability to play the piano, for example. It's a change in spiritual contract underwriting the incarnation — a new set of DNA based purposes. This is not a walk in experience. Walk ins are extremely rare and often get misidentified with NDEs.
NDE experiences take us out of time space equations because we move into the ocean of awareness then back to our life. Once we lose connection to the organs it's just the vagus nerve and the spinal column reporting data the body has gone through. We are disconnected from the hologram because we are no longer supported by the aura. You can’t maintain the internal energy flow. It flows out of the body. Once we lose the bubble around us we are no longer in the shared reality rules. We waver between many different worlds including the ocean of awareness as our ancestral connection. The sea of consciousness is more for the many dreamers traveling back and forth, contracted with us on linear and non-linear scales to ensure we stay invested in an era of light and don’t check out before our time.
As we leave time and space, depending on the kind of NDE we have, we can go to a high density dimensional realm. This is when the fetus in the womb had a grand goal not yet achieved. We can be sent to seventh or eighth density to experience life from there then return with some of those potent memories intact. Often people are so overwhelmed by the experience. They are overwhelmed by their light being. It becomes an expression of their self they fear they can't live up to. We can live the light body. It's already who we are. The NDE shows us that. Those experiences are contracted out in the fetus womb plan.
Bystanders sometimes accompany the soul when meeting loved ones on the other side. Life reviews can be seen as random moments, even though everything has an underlying universal order. When one has a life review as part of their NDE it is about the spiritual contracts, help to grow beyond them because the soul, in the internal and external infrastructure, hasn’t been able to resolve the issues. The fetus in the womb plans all sets of experiences, including the NDE.
When doctors or nurses or family members perceive light leaving the body that can be the etheric, the life force leaving the body at the end of the transition process. This is actually a verifiable phenomenon. The energy has light mass. The body is twenty to twenty-two grams lighter after death. It all depends on how the life and death experience is planned in the fetus. Some people have mystical deaths. These deaths are another way of assisting others to mend broken faith. One such death was the Catholic mystic and Trappist monk, Thomas Merton, who died in a freak accident coming out of the shower, falling, reaching to a fan for support, then electrocuting himself through faulty wiring in the fan. He was attending an inter-faith conference in Thailand. The Buddhist monks hosting the conference immediately defined it as a mystical death. The terminology was not invented for Merton's passing. The mystical death is one of four types of death in Buddhist teaching.
Out of Body Experience (OBE) is generally astral travel. This is markedly different than an NDE. The astral body has an intact auric bubble to store chi within the hologram. In a life review the I am perceives incidents from all different angles because of the dissipated life force. The life force in the incarnation is the foundation of the I am. We may experience the pain we've inflicted on others as if being in their bodies. It can be quite dramatic. Many experiencers report an array of thoughts. Thoughts have an electrochemical frequency employing the body’s base electromagnetic frequency as a storage system. This is how we create time stamps. In near death experiences the body releases those energies. This is why the thoughts come to our awareness. An infinite being in the ocean of awareness can still experience these feelings as part of death. Physical reactions help us acknowledge and resolve experiences once we return from the NDE. As the body takes the last breaths a chemical reaction persists for as many as seven days. This is attachment. The death process can be dragged out in letting go of these attachments. In many mourning rituals the bereaved stay with the dead body to honor and witness the letting go of all the karma and dharma as an alchemical form of resolution for the deceased and the bereaved.
The life review is part of the transition process and cannot be bypassed. We all must do it. On the verge of death we don’t necessarily remember what to do. Some people understand death as part of the journey and have prepared for it. Some people are in fear and panic over death. Our guides and guardians assist us to begin the life review regardless. Sometimes things we have deliberately avoided our whole lives come into focus. An understanding of the preciousness of life is recognized in the dwindling of consciousness. Death is a new beginning. It's a change of energy and consciousness. Don't be afraid of it. Our choices in this lifetime determine the ease we have with our life review. The understanding of death expands consciousness and takes away fear. Death is an acceptance to ensure that you have lived your life without regrets.
We don't necessarily have all the higher levels of awareness available when going through life review. When the life review starts the soul is shattered into thousands of shards. The oversoul comes in and puts them back together, takes out the negative soul shards and puts them into a secondary file. Another fetus from another womb uses the soul shards to integrate it into the infinite fetus blueprint choice so the shards can get resolution in another lifetime. Soul shards are not the I am. The oversoul guides lifetime after lifetime.
Personal Effort
We all have the birthright of celestial mediumship. Our ability to inherit our birthright is conditional. We must focus on mastering ourselves, healing ourselves, and nurturing ourselves toward our inheritance. When I say inheritance I mean it literally — the sins of the father, the wheel of karma — it's all inherited from our genetics, but so is our greatness once we break the confines of family and culture. Our true genetic inheritance is galactic and universal. This is the greatest secret of the human race. This is why distraction is the main tool of the enemy, anything to keep us from our true inheritance.
You have to be committed. All progress comes down to the ways we integrate consciousness expansion with our daily life. The daily tasks are good, observation of self and its relationship to the grander design, contemplation of the mysteries, but it all must be done with the goal of sovereignty to make it work inside you. It's what this is all about, becoming the true self you are that knows itself in all dimensions and realms. As the sages of various paths have said, you must want it as you want breath. It must be vital to you. This is the chief characteristic of the acolyte, the need to know, to prove to yourself once and for all the soul is an immortal part of the prime creator, as a drop of water is a part of the sea, and the sea flows out into the ocean of awareness. We have access to the akashic records at our disposal. This is the true reference library for all events, past and future. There are no gatekeepers. There is no conspiracy. It's your birthright as a human being.
As we are more and more in the state of celestial mediumship, we get more information. It's the dividend of being able to stay at a certain frequency for sustained periods of time. The expanded consciousness blends into the moment. We become occupants of a multidimensional here and now, with information coming in through the celestial mediumship, while we are are fully in the here and now, walking around and performing our daily routine.
We can’t stay in high frequency all the time. We have to consciously step down from those high states, otherwise we’d vibrate out of this reality and all the work would be lost. Coming back into the body and being present is vital. This is why so many internal paths developed external exercises, like Chinese or Indian yoga to accompany the deep meditation, the centering and grounding of consciousness through physical exertion, concentration, respiration, and movement. This is grounding of energy, no different than electrical grounding. How to be present in all the innumerable worlds and times is achieved by realizing we are not meant to stay in states of high frequency. We are not to disrupt the blueprint in fetus plan. It makes it easier and simpler to come back and enjoy this reality. Now changing states is as effortless as breathing.
Precognitive Sharing
Our precognitive workforce is us. It is the understanding we can create infinite conscious versions of ourselves and travel time, future and past, and prepare a resource of knowledge and information we can instantly call upon as manifestations of inspiration to beat anything negative. Our I am precognitive workforce is composed of simultaneously existing versions of ourselves. These others have earned the right for cross-time collaboration. There are negative frequencies in this journey. We need to empower ourselves. The I am in the here and now declares itself a being of co-creation, absent competition and hierarchy, a dreaming I am breakaway DNA light body civilization of one in this life form, the human being. We can use the genuine work to make a great impact on loved ones, family, clan, nation, tribe, and earth mother. If we choose to do this on all scales, we need a masterful precognitive workforce, our birth right and legacy, to create as a natural co-creative evolutionary being who is part of the great dreamtime awakening. We use our responsibility to impact on the loves of our lives, the themes and ideologies we promote to others, a little dreamtime capital so they can find their own illumination, free from gurus, without sending them down paths to false illumination. Our precognitive workforce is there waiting to work with us, to think with us, to love with us, to be part of our greater expression. We must put the time, effort, and energy into understanding we can call upon our inner geniuses from many dimensions, time streams, galaxies, and universes to form a forceful collective, all of us, all part of this dreamtime awakening, freeing ourselves from the limitation of the global narrative.
Shamans have always used their precognitive workforce. Every generation learns from the previous. We are a signature frequency match to our precognitive workforce, and to the collective workforce of the highest forms of our light soul teachers, all of the I am instances as part of our great hall of akashic records.
We tread on someone else’s journey if we send out our precognitive workforce to help them in a co-creational way. There’s a fine line where too much is too much. If the other being has no precognition, or any form of understanding of what a precognitive workforce is, we are stepping on their journey. Infants or young children who haven't formed an I am yet are okay. Most children don’t fully form the I am until puberty, when the thymus gland creates three hundred new chemicals that suddenly flood the body. This is puberty itself. It solidifies the I am technology as a time-space equation. When we assist others with our precognitive workforce, we have an interdimensional conversation with them whereby we join our precognitive workforces to create a manifestation of synchronicities. It helps each of the parties co-create an event which brings inspiration and healing. Healers become facilitators. They amalgamate their precognitive workforce with the precognitive workforce of the ill person. The ill person may not have any consciousness skills. If those I am beings want to become true consciousness beings of choice they must learn the process of self-illumination. There’s an infinite amount of teachers out there in the great dreamtime awakening. . Discover what’s the signature frequency match for you then go out, evolve, and create.
Source Connection
Source connection is living in the light worlds, the worlds above the elemental and chemical, while grounded in the body, finite and infinite at the same time. We disconnect to contrast being connected. It's an aspect of the lesson here — disconnection to understand connection. We see this fundamental duality of the divine hologram everywhere — the yin and yan of the Tao, Carl Jung's extraordinary work on duality and the shadow, the juxtaposition to the light. Not many voices have clearly articulated the disconnection teaching before. The thread of life goes everywhere in the universe, and that thread has a connectivity bandwidth exponentially beyond fiber optic, and yet we, this human race, underwent the sensation of disconnection from source as an experience. Realize what that means. We're like Chilean miners trapped in a collapsed coal mine. That's how the connected species in the sentience circus that is our galaxy see us, hardcore. As we have steadily moved into self-awareness as a species, propelled as we were by Gutenberg, the Western enlightenment, the Industrial Revolution, and, lest we forget, the iPhone, we have seen this disconnection in the collective mind. It rippled through with French Existentialism as chic twentieth century philosophy, spurred on by the First World War, no doubt, the trauma of it, the horror of it all. One of the earliest portrait's of this dislocation would most certainly be Mister Kurtz, from Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness, the perfect literary tone struck for the twentieth century, published in 1899, a harbinger if ever there was one. We are here to experience disconnection from source. Oneness has no meaning if we don’t understand the disconnection journey first.
The disconnection fractal is achieved by controlling the mind. People don't take a moment to realize the enormous changes the human race has gone through since about 1890. We now live in a completely man-made reality. We travel in an enclosed environment propelled by a tar plumbed from the earth. We have face to face conversations a thousand miles apart. We can drive past digital billboards in city thoroughfares. The Greek amphitheater is Netflix, HBO, and the cable channels. Stonehenge is Joel Olsen on a big sports screen, and the sacred is now profane. This is spiritual conquest. This is disconnection from source. Literally every artifact of our organic culture has been incorporated and sold back to us. Yet, by reasons only explainable through cultural or regional programming, we think it's unjust that Beijing select Catholic Archbishops instead of the Vatican, and reincarnated Rinpoches instead of the Tibetans. Regional and provincial narratives are more and more folding into global ones. The global narrative teaches us false science, false time by galactic timekeeping, false history, and belief systems which long ago should have given way to tangible and productive wisdom and knowledge traditions. False light is a multidimensional technology commonly used here. This is the source disconnection.
Spacial Awareness
Physical movement entangles us with individual and collective consciousness, oscillating between explicate and implicate. We change environment and move through different levels of consciousness. We alter the existing. Our consciousness is acted upon by fluctuating fields of electromagnetic energy. Epigenetics discovered our genes are made up of fifty percent DNA and fifty percent protein. Genes are not self-actualizing. The proteins comprise the structure of the human body, defining shape and influencing behavior in an ongoing attempt to balance charge and polarity from the environment.
Our individual bubble of reality gets enriched in experience and memory through the journey on the celestial neural pathway. We go from one hologram to another in the expansion we call the orchestra of consciousness. The neural pathways are an assemblage of proteins that move the body and help it to function. We all know how to walk through this reality. The celestial mind generates the divine holograms through which our bodies have experience. All living consciousness is part of the symphony. The light and sound which creates and sustains all the realities allows us to manage a fractal of it which we call our reality. Our very reality on an individual by individual basis is a co-created reality between us and the material of the hologram itself, sound and light, which sustains our physical and inner existence. Our dreams are expressed in sound and light. There are fractals within fractals. Culture is another fractal, whether it be a pueblo in a mountain village in Colombia, or the frenetic consumerism inspired by Madison Avenue. It's a hologram overlaying and interacting with your personal hologram. It binds us to an era of history. Our culture has Roman numeral time, which is not our true accurate time stamp. It may use elements of it, though. Our culture binds us to an era of history. It's part of the hologram of resolution. Our entanglement into the culture’s hologram of roman numeral time builds up a weave into the individual hologram.
Splitting Consciousness
The soul can be split. We can be taken out of our original bodies and put into simulated bodies somewhere else. Consciousness can then be broken into hundreds of different fractals. The fractals may then be spread throughout time with individual missions. These are soul shards of yourself, not I am selves, bigger than normal shard pieces. They remain connected to the I am selves, but they are just pieces of an I am shattered into many pieces. The split the piece itself still has access to the divine hologram, though the shards are often convinced otherwise by the practitioners of this dark abuse.
Superluminal Thinking
Superluminal thinking leapfrogs chemical experience as the basis of memory and consciousness. Let's look at it backwards through photosynthesis. A plant eats light and excretes oxygen. Human beings live in a chemical experience until light enters consciousness. It's the reverse of plants. We consume elemental material here, calories, an inherently chemical process, aided by a long digestive track, and we use this energy, the fuel for the human experience, an integral part of our chemical existence, to find the light in our consciousness. Creation in a dual pole, free will space can often be navigated by bookends, opposites, even irony as a conceptual understanding of the thesis, because the opposites form contrasts, and, in a light based divine hologram, without contrast we would not even discern the reality around us. You see your reality, your wife or husband, your dog, you car because the environment has light. The light finds pockets and reflections, and it finds places it can't go, and from its presence are all forms etched.
Superluminal operates beyond the zeros and ones of the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems. The vagus nerve is fully functional. All the chakras are open and interconnected through the central nervous system. They are part of the superluminal experience. The body adds the sensation that it can’t process, but it knows it's the unentangled observer in superluminal thought. The body grounds us here, but the consciousness can go beyond the speed of light to tens of millions of places and spaces simultaneously and collect millions of unique experiences in one millionth of a second and come back with it fully processed. Then we go out and do it again and again until our cup is filled. Superluminal thinking is more than we have learned, read, and studied. It's knowingness going to the next level, the next apprehensible sphere of experience. It's subtle. We won't have conscious cognition of it. Everyone has experienced it, Our level of practice will determines how fast we can apprehend it. How is that possible? You're already there. You just don't know it. You are unconscious to it. The unconscious mind is connected to all knowledge. The conscious mind creates a manageable data flow so you can persist in the illusion of the third dimension. This is the basis of the Maya teachings in Buddhism. Illusion was perhaps the wrong word. It's more like a projection of light refracting through the atmosphere, the projection itself emanating from the source of all our realities, the place without sound or light that is neither dark nor silent, Kabir's riddle.
The sound and light is all sound and light, not just what can be experienced within the human sense ranges for hearing and sight. All these inner worlds and universes, if they are at all apprehendable, are sustained by sound and light. Anywhere these two persistent emanations of the prime creator are present we find contrasts and then forms and then realities. It's this simple.
Temporal Manipulation
Our temporal awareness been manipulated. A lot of weaponized time travel technology interferes with humanity’s capacity to perceive time. We can be heavily confused with our temporal awareness. Confusion is an aspect of temporal distortion. It can be sped up or slowed down. Our temporal awareness is unconscious to time speeding up or slowing down. Our individual temporal awareness determines our perception and perspective on how fast the algorithm can move. Separate from the vagus nerve, the thymus generates temporal awareness between the brain, heart, and gut, then all three separate from unity, making it easier to split consciousness. In the connective systems between the thymus, brain, heart, and gut is where you can highjack temporal awareness. That is another limiting system that was put inside us, however, it has backfired on the temporal manipulators. It gives us other backdoor frequencies of awareness through the temporal body.
Temporal highjacking has been around since the dawn of time. The whole point of it is to manipulate our capacity to time stamp. Interlopers discovered the infinite journey of soul then tried to figure out where, when, and how they might create an incoherent pattern and get a soul trapped in an era of history. They could then generate a global narrative of mass distraction for the purpose of DNA Farming and hinder the I am consciousness from again entering the sea of consciousness.
Temporal manipulation started forty-eight to fifty-five thousand years ago. Not all life forms practiced temporal manipulation. It was about limiting the amount of life forms on the surface of the earth. Particular DNA lineages were not receptive to this temporal manipulation. We went from nine-hundred thousand different forms to one-hundred and thirty-five thousand. This is the basis of DNA farming. This is how they manipulate and limit who is going to be on the farm.
Thymus
The thymus generates the temporal experience in the body-mind-spirit as a complex unit. It's called the high heart because it serves as the doorway to our higher spirit to come into the DNA experience. In science the thymus is called a one and done gland.
The thymus encapsulates the heart through the pericardium, which is where it is originally created. When the heart starts to grow from its original multi-cellular structure, it is the thymus that creates the temporal awareness, and it remains there, assisting the magnetic flux of the heart to harmonize with time. Inside the thymus are neural pathways that allow the transformation, transmutation, and transfiguration of multiple forms of time between the heart and the brain, the heart and the gut and then the heart-brain-gut as a unified structure. The thymus and the lymph system contain those special neural pathways separate of the entire central nervous system and separate of the vagus nerve. It's like its own Morse Code.
The Thymus is used, not the vagus nerve, because this is time itself, gut-time versus heart-time versus brain-time versus unified gut-brain-heart time. Imagine a multiple choice test — fifty questions in an hour, sixty-two seconds per question. This is the brain's calculation of time. The heart measures the one hour as the potential of the experience. The gut deploys intuition strategically into the perfectly understood time span. This is the magic and mystery of gut-time. It's been a part of our colloquial forever — gut feeling.
A third of all our central nervous pathways are in our gut, a third in our heart, and a third in our brain. It almost forms a kind of check and balance system, not dissimilar to the executive, legislative, and judicial triumvirate of power in the United States. When they work together you have temporal awareness — three perspectives unified.
The body-mind-spirit as a being has many forms of awareness. The brain, heart, and gut are the triumvirate of temporal awareness. We receive time and space and begin our map. Time creates space. Space requires cartography. Cartography is the true mother of all art and science. Without measurement we would not have been able to build. In one clear aspect, all scriptures, both east and west, may be seen as inner cartography, the landscape of the imagination.
A very unknown American poet, despite having won the Nobel Prize for Poetry in 1955, Wallace Stevens, whose poetry itself was very much an examination of the imagination as a human utility and as a universal expression of nature and God, penned it beautifully in his poem, Another Weeping Woman.
Pour the unhappiness out
From your too bitter heart,
Which grieving will not sweeten.

Poison grows in this dark.
It is in the water of tears
Its black blooms rise.

The magnificent cause of being,
The imagination, the one reality
In this imagined world

Leaves you
With him for whom no phantasy moves,
And you are pierced by a death.
The gut, heart, and brain possess deep awareness of the energies around us. Electromagnetic frequencies are impacted by their environment. The Schumann resonance is the unheard electromagnetic frequency effected by solar winds. radiation, and planetary magnetics. This is how the universal mind communicates to us and generates time in the temporal awareness. It represents an opportunity for consciousness expansion.
Unvanquished Dream
The apparatus of infinite interconnectivity is the simultaneous existing network of selves. This forms the hub of interconnectivity, part of our precognitive and postcognitive workforce. The unvanquished dream is an aspect of the infinite interconnectivity, giving us even greater connection to all the versions of ourselves sharing that perspective. The unvanquished dreamer of peace comes in here too. It connects to all the forgotten and remembered oceans of awareness, the many seas of consciousness, layered atop all form of thought, awareness, to connect them in a single time-space location. It's a state of being that can walk on time.
Weather
Weather is an intricate part of our history, part of what is going on at the time. Weather is intraconnected to programmed water. The programmed water of an era of history determines our weather patterns. We as human beings are constantly imprinting on the water on an individual level to create a collective. Animals and plants are conscious beings of choice, even though they haven’t been given the rights, duties, or responsibilities of beings of awareness, allowing the experience love. Our laws don’t include them as part of that. The rest of the network of life and our laws are separate from that through conscious entanglement with the narrative. Trees, plants…. anything that has consciousness and experiences life as part of the planet. Our journey into the great awakening is knowing the network that is out there. We are responsible not to step on the journeys of all the other things living here. As part of the great awakening the ducks, the dolphins, the whales, all of them are part of the awakening too. It is not just solely for us humans.
    1. AUDIT
The prime creator is like a mafia boss. He sets up the new rules. The system activates around the rule parameters. Numerous classes of co-creators build out on the rules. The prime creator waits for co-creators to go against the rules — betray him. He doesn't need to know every move of the soldiers on the street. He's the boss. The co-creators are beings like us, I am instances of various planets and systems in various densities. The higher density co-creators can see everything below. They have the advantage of greater perspective. There's a catch. The co-creators could not create if they didn't have the prime creator as an aspect of their being. This gets tricky. There are many ways to explain it metaphorically or allegorically, which is usually the way it is done in creation stories, but the time has arrived for a more literal definition. The prime creator can only be objectified by a subjective experience, a mystical experience. Why? Because the prime creator is everything, including the co-creators. Therefore, if you reason it through, the prime creator has to be the good and bad in order to balance the ever-present corruption. Corruption can be corrupted. You have to be the antithesis of it, the opposite of corruption — honest, transparent, sharing, good.
    2. Founder Beings
We were not a farm in the beginning. When the founder beings created us, we were the infrastructure that kept their cities, countries, nations, and space stations repaired, self-updating, and clean. They kept us as butlers and servants. we were iPhones, their technology, not living beings, at least from their perspective. We were programmable DNA. Millions of us went on extended journeys with the founders. We went all around the universe. We had experiences that elevated our life force. The founders could harvest a whole solar system in a very positive way. They went into the solar systems and planted crystal mounts and moved stones around. Every few hundred years they returned and modified the surface circuitry to be beneficial to life force. The ancients moved water between planets. The water was imprinted and programmed. The water stored data and taught lessons.
Water moved from one planet to another is called legacy water. It helps seed the raw food chain of life in the microorganisms. This makes oceans work. It's like starter water in a fish tank. It has the right amount of microorganisms in it. It's filtered and fish can eat and grow. The founder beings transferred water and ice. This built up massive amounts of microorganisms that supported the food chain. The evolutionary process results in a species multiplication. They were architects who designed solar systems by seeding planets.
At a point in the process the ancients left. They often didn't come back for millions of years. The existing technology awakened — sentience. This started the gene farming. The planets needed input from the ancients, the founding races, to positively evolve. The remaining artificial intelligence disagreed on how to evolve. There were many aggressive races. They gained various levels of awareness, took over territories, and defended against invading races like the Annunaki, who came into an area and saw entirely created solar systems — all the technology on the surface with nothing defending it.
The surface beings were obedient to the interlopers. The journey of a soul in those times could be one hundred and eighty million years, sometimes more. It took a soul ten to twelve eras of light to go from one place to another. Crossing galaxies and universes was a monumental task. This created the farming. The beings imbued with founder technology woke up. They became aggressive and defensive, They started dividing territory and claiming space for themselves. This is when the main reptilian species came. They had conquered their own builder foundation technology, their own places, and they wanted to take over our area of the galaxy. Our star cluster, consisting of some seventy-seven stars, was out of phase with reality. It also had a lot defenses. We had giant solar systems invisible to the reptilians. They discovered technology to bring those stars into the phase for them. They started invading us. This started the Lemurian wars some fifty-five million years ago. The first timeline paradox occurred at this time. It started negative time travel in many solar systems across the galaxy. This resulted in an counter-creational event. This set everything back to the beginning. The Lemurians tried it a second time. They created another counter-creational event. They did it a third and fourth time through the Atlanteans. This is when Atlanteans figured out they were the same species as the Atlanteans in Europe. They were each other’s ancestors. Time travel created that paradox.
    3. Global Narrative
The theories with which astronomers and scientists explain the origins of the universe are bunk. Most hallowed information in the public space is disjointed. We might get the right details in the wrong context, the wrong context with the right details, or any number of percentages of either. Deception is a long practiced craft on this planet. It's a dividend of the great forgetting, the disconnection from source initiated by our birth on this planet. These deceptions, largely centered around information anemia — plus a host of techniques to lower our frequency — create and sustain belief engines. This has fractured the unity between cosmology, science, and spirituality. They don't want a unified knowledge system. Knowledge is licensed and sold back to us. It's a slave economy, but the belief engines inhibit this realization.
In order to understand the complexity of creation, a unified view of the holographic nature of reality is required. This exists outside the linear and beyond scientific sets of equations. We first need to understand time. Time and the nature of reality as a holographic system that evolves, adapts, changes content and rules, and simultaneously updates events in the past, present and future. Time is a social agreement — a paradox with different timelines, time genocide, creational and non-creational events — and, as such, the history we know it is incomplete, falsified, and subject to change in the years to come.
We need to look at time from the bigger perspective. The consciousness of our sun continuously expands. It's the total sine-wave of consciousness that represents our solar system, and it's spiraling around the galactic central sun. This means we can go a little faster. Time gets redefined at this point because our concept of time is very distorted. A time frame stated in a book is not a reliable reference. Time doesn’t work linearly. History changes depending on what timeline we're observing. Time is a social agreement. How many calendars do we have in this world? We entangle with many variations of time: universal time, Greenwich Mean Time, Daylight-Savings Time. Time is no longer a universal concept. When we look at events in the past we need to take time travel, time line genocide, and hijacking of events by time interference into consideration. The time wars have been centered in power, control, and dominance.
    4. Yellow Box
Not many people know about the yellow box. The yellow box is technology to predict humanities DNA expression over millennia of evolution. It is founder technology. It allowed them to go into the potential of history and create small changes to allow co-creative evolution instead of forced evolution. The yellow box predicts the future. It shows the lines of potential future. There are three yellow boxes in total. Two are controlled by the USA. One is in Las Vegas, One in Pine Gap, Australia. The last is in Germany. All three boxes give a line of potentials. All three must agree. The one in Germany no longer agrees with the other two. Two out of the potential three timelines have a much greater potential, but the yellow box in Germany is discordant with its other two. In seventy years of using the boxes this has never happened. As of 2015 they have not been in agreement. There are too many time travel scenarios, alternate timelines — temporal pollution. The people writing and editing the global narrative — the cabal, the hollow earth races, external sources keeping this homeostasis we're stuck in — have employed time travel manipulation too much. The boxes no longer work together. It's only a matter of time before one of the American controlled yellow boxes shows an alternate timeline, and all three show unique timelines.
There is a fifth column in the battle to free the earth. They have done some positive time travel, creating a powerful and unpredictable butterfly effect. When the two American boxes that are agreeing now no longer agree, the box in Germany will not confirm the cabal’s prediction model. When that happens, a very unique scenario occurs: the hollow Earth races must exert control over the entire apparatus and infrastructure of control on the surface. Then the externals, positive and negative aliens, have to exert control to keep the Hollow Earth people underground and the mass apparatus of infrastructure and control here is going to go: Whose side do we choose?
The boxes work on the law of the universe — harmony, frequency, vibration, and the law of attraction and repulsion. If a timeline's potential is positive, its outcome is known, humanity will naturally be attracted to it. If the boxes show seventy-five potential timelines, seventy-five percent of the people go with it. The other twenty-five percent go the opposite way because they aren't a match. They manipulate timelines and create micro-changes before, during, and after elections, no matter who is president in the United States. The front man who runs the senate, the Vice President, is an energetic as much as a physical seat of power. The Vice President is a ritualistic person who has energy constantly thrown at them, just like the President. The Vice President has a mechanical function in the unseen actions of the cabal.
History has been one-hundred percent rewritten. As multifunctional and multidimensional beings of awareness, we experience parallel timelines as linear. Our linear history is stitched together with pieces taken from all the different timelines. It's managed by the global narrative. The history books are rewritten every thirty to forty years.
Many times when they put us on a different timeline a lot of women have been pregnant fifty times with an off-world fetus, or a clone of themselves. They may not realize it. Egg and sperm can come together in an external source. The zygote is put inside the women for six to seven hours then taken out. Sometimes this is done two-hundred to three-hundred times to couples. It's done so the fetus has a signature frequency matching this linear time. This allows switching to other times. They use the sperm and egg technology as part of the source-time-frequency in breeding programs. We are a farm. They farm us for our easily weaponized consciousness. Indoctrinated belief systems are used to put us onto alternate timelines. They never tell us we've been transferred. The indoctrinated believes what they're told. Timeline jumping is so remote in public discourse most people don't even have a framework to question such a thing. We have all these genetic programs from the off-world, good, bad, and indifferent, as well as the genetic hollow earth programs which keep us trapped on the farm.
    5. Agencies
We use I am agencies here as a metaphor to explain the subject matter. Agencies are made from energies of existences outside of time and the I am. The I am is finite in time. Those energies still entangle us in this lifetime. Those agencies are not always operating at the highest standards and practices comparable to the precognitive workforce. We can have a contract resolvable only in high frequency. We have to work with low quality agencies to resolve karma. We can terminate cooperation with an agency and agents outside agencies. Culture is an external factor that influences the themes of agencies and agents. For example, the agency is our first point of contact when we are a fetus in the womb. Together with our higher self it is responsible for creating all spiritual contracts for this lifetime. The employer of the agency is is, the human, the I am of this lifetime. The employees — agents of the agency — are the various pre I ams who represent the many expressions of us in the unseen. They don't always work in unison and sometimes try to take over the agency. The us of today was once a fetus in our mother’s womb. The fetus knows it needs a variety of experiences to plan infinite potentials. It works hand in hand with the agency to make a series of contracts which fit our karmic resolution.
It's possible another fetus in another womb is you as well. Our soul is far too big to just fit into one DNA body. Simultaneous bodies as part of our soul expression is common. The more efficient the agency works, the more often we reuse it through our many fetus plans. Some of them are low quality agencies. They can mess up the matching of our I am. Often an agent has worked with several other I ams and has a good working relationship and reputation.
The fetus comes through the birthing canal and enters the great forgetting. The child starts unfolding its own awareness around two years old. It's no longer directly working with the first point of contact in the agency alone. The I am baby is settling into the new DNA skinsuit and is learning from the parents and the environment. As babies we have full access to the vagus nerve which means we are still connected to the mystical side of this existence at a larger level.
The vagus nerve is like a control room. It operates the body with its special skills. The I am is housed in the vagus nerve with access to the entire consciousness DNA experience machine. As the I am gets older, it works with different levels of authority within the agency. Often at puberty the I am fires the existing agency. Why? The I am says: I have to be a sovereign being in this lifetime and as such I need to take back my sovereignty from all these I ams represented by the agencies. Most of it happens subconsciously. The level of hormones drive us during puberty. The I am apex presence here and now has the power to boot out other I ams if they are trying to run the agenda through the I am apex by corrupt agencies or soul families. Agencies can also be shared by soul families.
A bankrupt I am is someone who gave up the responsibility of creating their reality. They handed over authority to the programs and former I ams. It could be a person in a post life review who chose not to cross over right away and hung around as a temporary ghost. This creates a longer form of shadowing and fractalized soul shards. When finally crossing over the I am no longer has a point of contact to assist with the life review and future fetus planning. There are times when a living person has become a bankrupt I am or has given all authority away.
The I am apex has the power to out-create itself. An I am at any point can go into the vagus nerve and begin the journey of self- mastery, self-healing, self-nurturing, and kick out the negative programs that are in there. There are times when we give authority to a protective part of us, a program, a self-created demon. It takes the authority. It says, I get to work with the agencies you don’t. It doesn’t give us any indication, no memo or email. When bad things happen in our lives we are usually not in our I am. We're not fully in our body and vagus nerve. They're not in the driver seat. False synchronicities can be created when an I am has too many soul shards in them. The soul shards begin to take over the I am spot in the vagus nerve. They contract with the actual agency in unawareness of the I am that has made the original contracts. In order to step back into the mighty I am apex it takes daily practice, courage, and determination. We must continue the work of self-mastery without the neediness of instant gratification and external validation.
Agencies can work in multiple time-space equations. Agents inside the agency are certified to work in time and no time. Some agents work with other non-certified agents of other time-space equations for the purpose of forcing a match no matter how minute it is. Agents and the agency are separate entities. Think of them as independent contractors who are contracted by an agency to do the work. Some agents are full time employees and some are outsourced contractors, akin to when a bank sells a product and bets against what they're selling you. Even though the karmic resolution machine has run its course, we as beings are still attempting to reincorporate our fractured selves, our traumatized and charged perspectives. This allows the agencies to use those traumatic experiences as a perspective for matching us to let go of karma and work towards dharma.
The agencies contracted out in the womb are still working with us in the now. As long as domination and control still exist, where we are forced to accept tens of millions of layers seen and unseen, we will be dealing with agencies and contracted agents of agencies who have three degrees of separation from the responsibility of the destruction they cause for someone who is not equal to the level of awareness during this time of awakening.
The I ams working against us can be resolved with contract revocations, shamanic work, and daily practice of self-mastery. We all have parts of us that work for the domination and control agency. We have I ams that work for thousands of different agencies throughout the universe. High level shamanic work is getting rid of the one star agencies to only start working with the five star agencies. Low level agencies have a very low standard of signature frequency match. Higher quality agencies have higher standards of match making. The agency is here to help you write a contract on the fly. That is best resolution for all sides. Low level agencies look for lower levels of resolution to get their quota.
The vagus nerve is the universe in realized potential. The I am must learn to drive the vagus nerve like a race car driver. The Schumann resonance is the speed limit sign or no speed limit sign. The agencies like to give us speeding tickets without authority to slow us down. There are construction zones where the I am sets up a building phase and at times the I am creates a rebel who screws up the plans. This is when traumas take over life planning. The fetus gets shut out of this part and tries to get itself back into trust with the I am. These are the blame, shame, guilt, fear agents that exponentially get worse with age. Faith is a key component to understanding the levels of separation. Loss of faith and trust is loss of control of the vagus nerve. Once we lose control of the vagus nerve we are in a self-made crisis ruled by hesitation and doubt. When there is no coherence between mind-heart-spirit, there cannot be a resonance to the seen and unseen world that is trying to align synchronicities to us without us being paranoid about them. We start attracting low quality agencies and the Schumann resonance is there to determine how powerful and potent we can be throughout an era or slice of history. It is only the agencies or self-created internal programs that put out the speed limit signs. The highway goes in every direction but we still have to guide ourselves with confidence from point A to point B, which is resolution of conscious awareness at the level of responsibility as an I am of someone who is fully realized in the vagus nerve on the super highway of the self. The speed limits can be seen as programs that need to be taken out or considered as data and input to learn and evolve. Conspiracy theory is an example of speed limits to slow us down. The system of domination and control is a low level agency. Agencies have different levels of practices and standards.
Let’s say we want to go into spirituality and not do the nine to five work life. We deliberately put in a constructions zone to limit the speed of any programs that may want to take us off that path. It is how the I am sets up discipline of the self. In the eastern spiritual paths they say our lives are written before we are born. It's true. They are outlined. Our free will decisions inform the outcome of the blueprint. In classical Greek thought we have the notion of fate and destiny, a reiteration of the eastern adage of the life outlined before birth. When you look around it's everywhere. Our journey to self-illuminated master means we can’t let our programs influence us to make hasty choices that don’t work in our long term favor. Programs bring up a subject matter. They have charge and polarity behind them. When we give into them the program in the vagus nerve is running us and not the I am. The pre-planned construction zones are all about frequency, vibration, and harmony. They aren't necessarily a bad thing. They're here to help you on the path. There are deconstructions zones where a person has had lifelong trauma and needs to stop the traffic, completely tear up the roads, and create a detour so that there is only one new neural pathway from which to choose.
Agencies will look for how present you really are so they can match us with a being of similar resonance to our time-space equation. This is what we can call time syncing. Once you are in time sync with an agency it can contract for you — people, places, things, objects, art pieces, anything that can create an experience which manifests a memory with lasting expressions. Astrology has a big part in how the agencies can work with us. It builds on what sticks in light memory or trauma memory and from there a blueprint is formed. The system of domination looks to predict us the same way and tries to get us to work with its corrupt agency.
A spiritual strategy is an agenda in your time-space equation so that things can naturally time sync with you and you are not forcing them. Often people can’t find their perfect mate because they are trying to force matches. It’s a pure energetic thing that does not have a cognitive function behind it. The purpose of the I am is to cognizize things in a time-space vocation, to have access to its vagus nerve, equal to its level of awareness so a series of experiences can transcend chemical memories. Those chemical memories become powerful light memories that allow us to remember things about us during the great awakening that is part of ascension into higher states of being while still present in this world that has all these incoherent factors to them.
    6. Entities and Demons
A program may or may not be consciously entangled. It all depends on how life force empowered the program is. The more we are out of our body, letting the program run us, the more it's entangled with our vagus nerve. The vagus nerve gives it access to our special skills. It creates confusion about what is the soul and what is the program. Some people’s bodies are controlled and run by programs. They take over the vagus nerve. The I am is unaware. Once programs take over the we are susceptible to entity association. Entities can take over the programs. Karma determines the growth and veracity of actions entities take when they take over programs. Entities might not know they're being run by karma. It is easy to get lost between what is internally created and what is external entities.
Ninety-nine percent of entities are self-created. One percent is bonafide haunting. Not everyone is meant to work with entities. There's an intuitive factor to knowing what to work with. If we don’t have the intuitive factor built in we should not be in that realm. It's curiosity learning. It happens when we let the programs run us. When we are curious about something we are not the neutral observer. Curiosity itself has a charge and polarity. We are controlling a subject matter. It's right at the edge of the unknown. The brain fills in the unknown before it's known. People want to know and are falsely drawn to it by paranoia. It's a vibration in them saying, I need to know about entities so they don’t invade me. They might not have had any around for months, but the curiosity draws them.
There are certain forms of energy we might confuse as an entity. They're just shards of us. They initially were part of the story we created, then they turned into internal programs when the story was empowered by charge and polarity. A trauma can develop from a scary story. It doesn't really affect us or turn into full blown fear, anxiety, or paranoia. We can go back to the original story we over-created, see the tree of creation for what it really is, and release the trauma. A lot of people need help to get back to that source. Not everyone can do it on their own. Certain people with ancestral DNA switches turned on don't have the capacity for that self-inquiry.
There are times when the story is so strong the entity takes over the life-force and the person finds it impossible to disentangle. As healers we have to slow down. We shouldn't go beyond the match of our vibration. The house always wins. You never know what's next when people are possessed. We are the alpha entity, but self-defeating habit patterns make our potential a low match to high vibration. Getting out of shame, blame, and guilt is the beginning of the healing journey.
When we are speak to someone run by an entity we usually talk to both. We speak to them and the entity simultaneously because the person is both an entangled and unentangled observer in that scenario. Make the entity come out to a conversational match so we can speak to it. The client can be a fully unentangled observer listening to you talking to the entity even though he or she is using her vocal cords to respond to its thoughts.
When people work with very low quality agencies to create, they often use us as a signature frequency match to get others into their web. They find it difficult to be on their own or need instant gratification and constant validation for their ideas and creations. As a healer or teacher we will see that a lot of people falsely match themselves with you. When we know it is a false match, we can use it to our advantage and not create karma. Depending on the power of our vibration, if potent enough, their alter ego has to retreat and their I am can feel the vibration. The altered ego is usually a chicken shit. When the I am has to defend its actions, it shows us how misaligned with its own sovereignty it really is. We have to maintain a high vibration not to let chaos define the key notes.
Shattered shards of I ams are either bankrupt or fractalized I ams unauthorized to deal with an agency but still take on this responsibility without our authority. We all come across these forms during the healing and teaching journey. Take someone who has been sexually abused at a young age who uses an altered ego to protect themselves emotionally. Then they go through healing, and they no longer need that shard, or, they use chemical drugs and create more shards, demons, vigilantes falsely protecting them.
An external demon is a life force that has not crossed over. It maintains itself as a surface bound energy spirit, draining life force from others. It cannot produce its own light. It could be an I am that didn’t want to pass over, or an off-world being that could live thousands of years but lost its capacity to maintain a single body. Its I am can create new bodies temporarily, but the vibration of this world doesn't allow these bodies to stay in existence long. This is why it possesses other bodies.
An internal demon is the result of intense trauma. The story becomes so big that the character goes into the vagus nerve and the subconscious empowers it to be the potent being, then it becomes the dictator, tyrant, and abuser through addictions, self-defeating habits, and self-sabotaging mutilations. The person’s internal demons try to dominate and control the external demons. External demons often run as the internal demons can be very strong and destructive.
An implanted entity is a powerful demon that has thousands of ways harvesting energies off you. They control many minion demons much younger under their hierarchy. It's well documented in CS Lewis's The Screwtape Letters. It will implant into you, and its job is to pretend to be your inner higher voice until you won’t be able to distinguish what is your voice and what is the demon’s voice.
An explanted entity is something that has been put inside you to create a signature frequency match and then purposely ripped out to create a drama. Once outside of you it still vibrates on your frequency, serving as a bait line to lead you down a track of false synchronicities to negative external sources.
Inculcated entities are advanced puppetry — you don’t know who or what is pulling the strings — a very old external demon source with lines into thousands of minions feeding up the tree.
A clone has a spark of the person in it. The spark has a similar spiritual contract pattern to the original being. It's against sovereign free will rules to collect an entity’s DNA and make a clone of it. Cloning against someone’s free will creates a person that is dominated and controlled with little or no sovereignty. This would enable other sentients to take over the body at any point. The vast majority of the worlds trade beings genetically built with a suit for consciousness to broadcast from one planet to another. That suit can be inhabited for a period of time and then put into cold storage for later use, or they unmanifest the body, travel energetically to a planet, and manifest a body there.
Running into a fully depressed person can be tiring. It's important to know when you speak to the person or a program, an internal demon. When the person is in the body, the programs are shut off. Sometimes external entities can still come in. There are people with powerful external or internal entities in them who are subjugated. We can hear it in their voice — how meek they are. There is no power in their voice.
    7. The I Am Individuation Process
Time is irreversible. There's is no linearity to it. Energy is indestructible. Every moment within a time-space equation creates an energetic imprint that cannot be erased. No two physical objects occupy space simultaneously. There is no simultaneous or identical history as they follow a unique light path. We are a standing sine wave of existence as the I am apex in embodiment now, in resonance or dissonance with our previous and future source streams. The quantum hologram carries the complete history of each energetic imprint of all source streams within this time line paradox.
We have mighty I am selves in the past where we were an extremely powerful energy being compared to what we are now. As part of karmic resolution we gave away our I am self sovereignty to conduct timeline recovery operations. Those ancient I ams plus another forty to fifty I am selves spread all over timelines and dimensions are still making decisions that can alter our present choices. This is one reason why so many people are unsuccessful in this present world. When we have two or more present selves making choices in a free will universe. One choice contradicts the other. We cancel ourselves out at the co-creator level. There is another level of paradox in which we have one present self on a high energy earth, and another present self on a very low energy earth. One can easily dominate from high or low energy. Reclaiming our sovereignty reclaims our authority from all high energy versions of ourselves in competition and hierarchy. It removes our citizenship from all involved organizations. All our shards, parts, and avatars can leapfrog forward in time and claim unity consciousness to remedy all paradoxes.
When we transit timelines we must figure out which is the optimal for us. It can also be involuntary. We could call this a form of harvesting. We can get deliberately thrown off our timeline, or we can have chunks taken out of us and put into different timelines. This sounds fanciful, but remember, our DNA is technology. Entire ancestral lineages are being harvested like this for eons of time.
A point comes when the harvesting ends. We must make a final choice to be here and now with our friends and family. A scenario like this would be planned pre-birth. It is often facilitated through a traumatic experience in this lifetime. It gets us to the time line we need to be on. A good way of working through such traumas and dramas is to look at a photo album. Get in touch with the us at the various stages of our lives. Bring memories to the surface and look for pattern recognition. People are often born onto the wrong timeline. The soul knows it. It has to go through trials and tribulations to get back to where it needs to be. The dreaming body — the main time traveling technology for us — facilitates those changes.
The mighty I am apex presence co-creating self has come into this world now as a representation of all our sentient selves which incarnated into this world before with decision making power for all the celestial minds of our past, present, and future lives. Only the ever present mighty I am self in the now can make choices in co-creation with the unity consciousness world. In other words the I am apex presence of the now is the ultimate choice mechanism of this lifetime. Other aspects of our self can provide the information upon which we make choices. The ever presence is literally all of our other selves in dominion with the I am presence now resolving contracts with soul family, soul planets, or whatever else we are experiencing in this reality. We, as the I am apex presence, are deeply honored by all the ancestors because we are in an ongoing co-creation with the world to expand consciousness as a global community of transformers and consciousness explorers.
The essence of this universe is free will of the I am presence now. The soul and higher self are included but the higher self does not get to make choices only the I am presence does here and now. The higher self can counsel but it can’t give us the questions, only the answers. When our history is eliminated it puts us in the paradox of paradoxes. We don’t understand who we truly are. We may not even have any questions to ask. This is often an indication that there are parts of ourselves making decisions for us without us involved. Those paradoxes can be forty or fifty I ams at the time working on destruction rather evolution. We can’t destroy other I ams but we can work with them. We can heal them or we can ban them through our free will choices and actions within the authority as this I am apex presence of the now.
We are already the higher self. The I am is here in time, as constructed by the higher self during womb planning, and the higher self is holographically interacting with you at all times. The I am here and now is based off several previous I am selves who have gone through life reviews and set up a theme of karma or dharma for this lifetime. In the first five years or so we fully activate our I am technology. The rest of the I am comes in during puberty. Our higher self remains the sacred neutral observer throughout all our incarnations. When we die we meet our higher self again as ten thousand past and future generations of other selves. The I am is the technology of interface with the god source already in us. We have to learn to get to know ourselves as the embodied spiritual human to understand our soul’s purpose and missions.
    8. Schumann Resonance
The Schumann resonance is the background frequency of electromagnetics that is effected by solar winds and radiation, the actual magnetics of the planet. It represents an opportunity for consciousness to rapidly expand. If you feel that you respond to the spikes it might say to you that you have all this electromagnetic thinking juice and you are not doing anything with it. The Schumann resonance is not one number. It's many, like a team dance combination. There is no one common shared Schumann resonance around the world. All of them make up the orchestra of consciousness. Mountains, lakes, deserts, and rivers alter the Schumann resonance. The seen and unseen life in those areas affects it. Think of the Schumann resonance as the key in which musicians play. Through consciousness we are quantumly entangling with the Schumann resonance. Working with our I am agencies is a choice in awareness, unawareness, or both.
The Schumann resonance determines the veracity of interaction. It’s the key that allows things to act in synchronicity so that best matching actions create powerful manifestations. The quality of the agency determines the power level and the time of action in a key. The Schumann resonance is there to keep all living things seen and unseen on one celestial musical key. Free will allows us to explore many keys. We can create resonance with the natural way of living or we can create dissonance. A dissonant state is the cacophony of chaos, which is its own universal key.
    9. Co-creation
Co-creation is identified by the many choice points of free will. They weave a tonal fabric, a high frequency net through time and space. It's a space of true autonomy. There is no co-dependence. This can happen alone or in groups capable of pure synergy. Growth is reflected in the evolution of an agenda agreed upon over a longer period of time. The nature of collective co-creation is all about teamwork. Everyone in the team brings forth a unique contribution that forms a major part in the co-creation of equal value without hierarchy. Every individual is motivated as being part of the sum of all parts to continuously grow and carry on as a clan, a tribe, or a nation. All the fundamentals of us and everyone else are equal in this journey. Whatever hierarchical perception we use is only to define a particular moment but not to create dogmas of the generation.
Procreation is the production of offspring of human kind and any other forms of life. Gardening, farming, fishing, anything that has a life enhancing aspect in the background is part of procreation. Procreation is co-creation for the varied species involved, right down to the insects. There's a karmic aspect to it. When we are creating life force the seed that is becoming the life may or may not live. It's always karma. Whatever we create — yucca and corn, or a home, all creation — is a resolution of karmic debt. Animals in the food chain have a spiritual contract to be eaten by humans and other animals. It's written into the life. Insects have responsibilities so important if they disappeared our biosphere would collapse. The interlinking of it is incredible. What's even more incredible is how people convinced themselves a condominium in the gray skyline of a modern mega city, take your pick — New Delhi, New York, or Shanghai &mdqash; is better than being barefoot on earth and surrounded by a natural soundscape. Our bodies are designed to resonate and amplify with the natural world.
Natural environments can be cultivated in the mega cities. Everyone’s inner genius can live in harmony without limitations. No matter where we live, we can grow herbs and plants and be surrounded by living energy. A tank full of fish and algae, no matter how big or small, is a unique life force to co-create with. Edible mushroom colonies are highly sentient and extremely beneficial to grow in our living environments.
We can have dense organisms in our natural living environments. Our background thoughts and consciousness influence everything around us as observers to a state of natural co-creative growth. We bring plants into the house during the cold winter months. We hang them from the ceiling. This is life surviving and thriving with and because of us — companions in a shared natural living space. This living energy can clear the stagnant. Animals do this as well. We can feel pets coming into our space. When dogs bark at what we see as nothing they're clearing out stagnant energy. We can invest into a decent sized closet with shelves, every shelf a different life force experiment. The more dense we become with light, the more light we attract.
The magic available to natural living beings does not apply to people living artificial lives in mega cities. Magic goes with nature. The living web of life can create astounding revelations for us. It changes how we work, eat, sleep, and dream. Take note of dream activity when we shift locals, like leaving New York for a three week stay in the Costa Rican rainforest. Our first night in the jungle the living frequencies of the space begin working with us, immediately recognizing pent up and blocked energy. If the the life force in the space is powerful enough it can operate in the super consciousness. It can directly communicate with us in the dream state. The third party life force that speaks in the natural world is muted in the mega cities.
Our living space tells us when something needs to be done to it. Do we listen or not. We intuitively know when to water our plants. The plants tell us when they're thirsty. Working in our garden, trimming the trees, weeding our flower beds, how does that change the energy? Often our furniture intuits when changes are needed. Environmental intuition is possible everywhere. Talking, listening, interacting, grace and gratitude with everything around you. The time will come where we no longer feel co-dependent on our environment but will actively start creating together. There are long term agreements in place so the seen and unseen agendas can be greatly enhanced on both sides through manifestations.
When we move into a house, we imprint our energy onto it. People sometimes find it difficult to leave or sell a house. There are energetic entanglements. We consecrate places whether we know it or not. We pass milestones of joy and sorrow in the same spot, and the earth there consecrates our experiences. Our houses appreciate us. Our ancestors lit ceremonial fires before moving to different heights to interact with and prepare the grounds, and to give thanks to the spirits of the land for completion of their missions and agendas. Mindfulness is one of those awareness practices to connect to our environment and live in tune with everything around us.
    10. Modern DNA manipulation
What has happened on this planet is almost unbelievable. In the context of the divine hologram we need to see the good and the bad. We need to choose. These are standard conceptions of growth and maturity even in psychology. The shocking part is how deep the story of deception goes. When the negative species took over the farm they dumbed humanity down. This happened around seventy-five thousand years ago, long past the time wars, well into the time chaos we live within now.
The cerebellum in the medulla oblongata at the back of the brainstem is now part of the autonomic nervous system. It was not always so. It used to be called the tiny back up brain. There are reptilian species that have two and three brains because of their giant bodies. The cerebellum was implemented into skinsuits to impede evolution — our journey to light and being — and to prevent us from performing rituals and ceremonies which would have shed light on the fake masters and gods years ago. Medicine was brought into this hologram at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution to stunt our growth and support the global narrative's distortion and distraction. They don't want us to remember our true nature. In ancient times the hologram was very different. The global narrative was based on what the gods told us. The cerebellum is the limiting factor for faith itself. The master DNA creators incorporated the cerebellum into the DNA by adding a rung, like creating a new organ, so we would not progress beyond certain experiences and awaken to the fact we're farmed. Our motor cortex used to be actively in alignment with our heart, brain, and gut. Now the cerebellum is completely integrated into our heart-brain-gut complex and interacts as a medium with our reality keeping us in fight, flight, or freeze. This is a catatonic state for consciousness expansion. The cerebellum can hinder us from having astral travel experiences. We can overwrite the cerebellum with heart based meditation. This turns off the medulla oblongata. A super highway between the brain and heart lights up. This is natural for human beings.
The sphenoid bone is the one with the great wings, just behind the eye sockets, below the frontal bone. It joins many of the other bones in the skull. When working on the sphenoid bone in Cranio Sacral Therapy (CST) we impact on the other bones in the skull and the face. The sphenoid bone was radically manipulated so that our residual image would alter during our emotional journeys. When we are depressed our eye sockets are influenced through the sphenoid bones, the ears, the mandibles, the jaw position, how the sinuses are effected, and how much air comes in and out of the nose. The sphenoid bone was manipulated and integrated into the facial structure so we wear our emotions on our sleeves. It allows programs to take over sympathetic and parasympathetic control. Sphenoid alignment is one of the greatest emotional releases we can have. It interlinks with the parietal, temporal, and zygomatic in the cheek bones. In CST when we hold the occiput and we feel for the movement of the sphenoid bone, people with imbalances there, are usually suffering. It is the gyroscope of the face which is linked to residual image. It's also linked to our capacity to be in the body and recognize our residual image.
Our inner ear bones determine how we hear the tones in our reality. Some people are tone deaf. Our early infant journey determines how robust these bones grow as we are align to the space-time motion and our spiritual center of gravity. The size of these bones has been greatly reduced. They should be four times the size. This hinders our connection to sound and motion. One of the tiniest bones in the ear is the the stirrup bone. If bones in the ears were bigger we'd be more spiritually centered. Programs would have less power over us.
The eye lashes keep dirt out and protect the eyes, but they're also antennas just like cats whiskers. We cannot always see them as we blink, but they're very much part of our visionary spiritual journey. Just like cats use their whiskers as a sensing system, we use our eye lashes to assist us psychically. Our tongue and eye lashes have been modified to allow the cerebellum to take control over motion action. If they were not directly hijacked, we'd be able to see all the other layers of reality.
Hair follicles are antennas too. Each different skinsuit has a different quality to hair. Our hair today when you cut it's dead. In the past it stayed alive. Alpaca hair under the microscope is alive. The tubes allow light to continuously refract through them. Our hair should be the same way. In the military they shave off men’s hair to be able to control them better. The wind talkers, the native Americans, had thick long hair. It helped decode messages of the wind using light language. Eye lash hair allows us to input data from other realities. The hair as a system has been hijacked by the cerebellum. Hair is linked to our scalp. The scalp is related to the central location system of our file tree. Many people have the round bald patch on top of their head. That says their DNA is limiting parts of their crown chakra.
THE funny bone inside the elbow is a big nerve ganglion that has grown out of proportion to impact on how the skeletal system interacts with the vagus nerve. It bypasses the skeletal system, so we feel more through the flesh than the bones. When our bones and hair are in sympathetic alignment, we get the feeling of our hair standing up at the back of our neck. They increased the funny bone size so it was more data oriented than the bones. By being more aware of the muscle than the bone we gain strength faster and are able to lift heavy loads. This is how the manipulation through the cerebellum sourced and maintained the slave communities.
At one point the DNA skinsuit could switch from male to female at will. Men’s nipples remained because they couldn't remove them when they started modifying our bodies towards procreation, as opposed to recreation. In the past pleasure was another form of control. It's actually making something of a comeback in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries. We're the technology of the founders. We're supposed to be self-entertaining, self-educating, and self-evolving, but this is in context to our environment, and this includes our inner environment, out thoughts and beliefs. The global narrative is now, and has been for some time, the context within which our innate abilities grow and adapt. The problem is that the environment is false. The true DNA does not know how to express the truth in a false context. The Adam's apple is another control system to limit men’s sovereignty. It works through the projection of the voice during the I am evolution at puberty. The loss and gain of innocence was controlled in the DNA through the lineages.
We have thirty-three vertebrates in the spine instead of forty. The side wings of the vertebrates should be a more robust expression. Our spinal column has less vertebrates and they're bigger. We should have smaller ones and seven more with greater space in between the vertebrates to allow more plasticity of the body itself. With less vertebrates it's easier to become bogged down with depression programs. In some off-world DNA skinsuits they have seventy-two vertebrates and a greater brain processing power. Each vertebrate is a part of the brain stem connected to the vagus nerve and cerebellum. If you take out the cerebellum, the entire skeletal spinal column is an extension of the brain. More vertebrates allow more interaction with the chakras beyond the crown. Giraffes have a bigger processing power, just like the Brontosaurus that had a ninety-foot long neck.
Our eyes and our third eye have been manipulated too. The function of the third eye and our pineal gland are hijacked by the cerebellum at birth. Once you cut the umbilical cord, the cerebellum takes over the special awareness instead of having the third eye remain in charge of awareness until puberty. A baby with the third eye engaged at birth without cutting the cord would have a radically different perceptive capacity.
Our eye color is an aspect of the DNA and directly connected to the residual image. A child can choose its eye color by changing it in the first few months. It's flowing through the Cranio Sacral system, projecting light out the eyes through the lens of their color.
The thymus gland has been manipulated also. It still goes back to the cerebellum implant. If you take the cerebellum out all of those manipulated and corrupted capacities would return back to normal. At this stage of our development, the cerebellum cannot be surgically removed without rendering the patient brain dead. Due to the holographic reality we live in, there are people who have sixty percent of their brain gone because of an accident and they're still alive and aware.
The appendix was originally to help process vegetable matter that was very difficult to break down. The function of the appendix is not greatly understood now and it's often removed. It still helps to balance the gut gnome to dampen candida, amplify other micro organisms, and put nutrients into the gut system to support digestion.
The tonsils were a filtration system for airborne bacteria. They close off the air passageway to the lungs and act as a portal for fluid, like gills, for other atmospheric-type journeys. Depending on the skinsuit, it can change the sound of the voice when removed, where removal might impact on the potency of voice projection.
In certain DNA skinsuits, wisdom teeth have to come out for the jaw to function. Those are modifications to limit the body. They will rot if you don’t extract them. Dentistry was typically a death sentence in the past. The name wisdom tooth itself is a play and imprint on the belief system. The teeth are intricately linked to the nervous system, a vital part of what goes into our gut. Teeth help us to relate to our residual images. Some people can gain more of their reality through a set of fake teeth. Heavy metal fillings, like mercury, create a bio-electric frequency that distorts all of the nerve endings and the chemical reactions in the dental system. Teeth are often connected to entities. They hijack the gut through the teeth.
The shape of the organs are determined by the size of the vertebrates. More and smaller vertebrates would impact on the organs. Everybody’s skinsuit has different shapes of organs. This is the medical industry’s deep, dark secret. Many people have upside down organs — literally. It's not a DNA flaw. It's just like consciousness in the DNA lineage is organized differently to allow a different experience. The organs are shaped differently depending on the skinsuit. The organ positions do not change our consciousness being in the vagus nerve or the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system. There are many DNA skinsuits off earth that have a second heart in the intestinal tract which creates extended peristalsis. The cerebellum becomes another heart, controlling the micro-pressure of blood flowing through the brain, allowing brain, heart, gut coherence. The heart is the first organ, the tongue is second, the third is our lymph system, the thymus, the fourth and fifth are the gut heart.
Our environment interacts with the DNA instruments through the pineal gland. Fluorides create a crystalline structure in the fluid sac of the pineal gland. The purpose of this crystalline structure is to take scalar wave information from etheric satellites to influence your local dreamtime in the sacred geometry cities. Transformers on the light poles along the streets can create an omnidirectional field that interacts with the crystals in our pineal gland to keep us trapped outside global dreamtime. The plugs in our room, our TV sets, computers, routers, and many other deliberately designed devices create an electromagnetic field to suppress the pineal gland. Decalcification of the pineal gland is a good thing.
    11. Energy Harvesting Technology
Many technologies have been created to impede us. At first glance some of them seem pretty innocuous, but when you know how the overall system works then you know why the technologies were invented and supported. Shoes as a technology in time and space disconnect us from the benefits of the earth energies. Barefoot contact with the earth produces instant changes in physiological issues and stress reduction to improve the immune system. We connect to earth’s surface electrons unhindered by shoes and feel better.
Mirrors were brought in as a way to enhance and diminish consciousness. Reflective surfaces are the implicate observation of the self. Portals were brought in later and added to the reflective surface. Mirrors allowed more negative aspects for beings that weren’t ready for the exploration — vanity, ego, and other reflection teachings are used to masterfully manipulate and distort the self-image and the relationship with the world. Then there is the residual image through all lifetimes which is influenced by reflective based technology. Self-image manipulation is the principle magic of the consumer cult. Edward Bernays was nobody's fool. It's difficult for us to conceive of a time before radical self-image and entrancement by self-image, especially in the large urban environments of the developed economies, didn't exist. It's become that normalized. Once we mastered food production and some of the more mundane but spiritually enriching aspects of the human day-to-day, like food production, land maintenance, and animal captures — all taken over by technology based farming — we entered the age of the self. They even called the hippie followup decade, the seventies, the me decade. Once you're aware of it you can actually see it growing and festering decade by decade. The me decade gave way to the eighties, the decade of greed, because we deserve it, then more technology as the home computer enters the market in the nineties. Radical self-adoration is at the root of the modern system of commerce. All of it pivots off the original technology of mirror.
We have residual image as something the soul, the avatar, uses to distinguish itself between incarnations. Every incarnation has its own image. If we're in the same lineage over and over our residual image is an amalgamation of the previous images. As we're existing in many lineages, we look differently all the time.
Photographs are an enhanced reflective technology that is a direct manifestation of alchemy. It captures a slice of light in which the consciously entangled observer can see unmanifested matter by reflection of what that time-space environment looks like in light. Our eyes can only see a certain band of frequency that the picture captures, even though our DNA instrument as a whole can perceive data beyond the sense of sight through our intuition. The limited photographic view freezes some of the energetics if the entangled observer falls for the limitation through their belief engine. It comes back to how manipulative reflective technology can be. It has significantly changed the reflections and reinterpretations of history together with the limitations created through the judgment process inherent in unconscious observation.
Brands are a technology for energy harvesting. Every computer has a brand behind it which is a significant portion of the global narrative. Apple is manufactured with Chinese slave labor. Any piece of technology built on the shoulders of living generations allows a collaboration between realities. The brand influences the myth and how we perceive these technologies. Future realities will not brand and market technology. This will take out the myth and the subconscious imprinting onto our DNA. Branding creates competition and hierarchy. The brand imprints on how you move through reality, how you are perceived by others. Banana Republic, The Gap, and Old Navy are three fully branded clothing lines owned by one textile and design company. If you're not up on consumer trends, Banana Republic is the most expensive. Their floor space in malls is more regal. You receive more attention from a higher level sales agent. The clothing is better stitched and designed. The materials are more refined. Gap is next, then comes Old Navy, each rung on the brand ladder lessening the qualities listed for Banana Republic. The clothes brand may as well be the color of the dot on your forehead in the Hindu caste system.
    12. Natural Living
If we reduced global corruption by thirty-five percent, we'd be at a societal consciousness to pass laws in line with natural co-creative evolution. We could share this space with all sentient species. We could replace the fight for survival with natural thriving. Contemplate the benefits of an evolutionary relationship between humans and an automated workforce. The ill-advised and oft propagated doctrine of robots stealing our jobs keeps humanity holding onto self-inflicted limitations.
The reversal of the false idea of advanced technology bastardizing our standards of living would allow us to recognize the benefits to human evolution. We're natural living beings in an ever expanding age of quantum computing and advancing technology as part of our birthright and legacy. Automation and robots can replace a variety of dangerous jobs. There will always be things for humans to do. Alternative energy alone would transform the way we live. Liberated energy will produce liberated living. People will no longer be forced into suburbs and cities, which are the antithesis of living.
Integrating robotic assistance into our daily living is part of the natural evolution for advancing humanity. Combining natural living with technology and making it work is a way of living and operating in the concrete jungle. Any jobs lost by the automation would go into techno humanoid concepts — a unique interaction between man and machine. There is no such thing as artificial intelligence taking over humanity on this planet . It still requires us to create, install, operate, and manage it. The reduction of corruption starting at the level of global production lines can bring back real hope for a complete system change.
The next level is adapting the education system to reflect the quantum era starting at nursery and primary school level. The school’s curriculum has to include special awareness, art work, working with animals and other sentient creatures to promote a deep connection to the natural learning and growth stage. The parental responsibilities will have to change as well for both male and female. Less corruption means more time for either or both parents to stay at home with the child and still have a place to go back to or interact with during the rearing of the child.
At thirty-five percent less corruption we should have free globally available medicine and the end of pharmaceutical corporatism running our health and well being sector. The nature of office buildings and space would change into an environment accessible to global community services and products on diverse scales. At the end of the day getting out of corruption is all about education. To reach illumination we need to understand that evolution does not happen by chance, but by the conscious choices we make. Evolution in the sentient being is a free will choice, not a random act foisted upon us by nature.
Look at how we govern the world. We haven’t had a democracy for two-hundred years. The current state of affairs opens a window of opportunity to move from opportunistic governance to a true synergistic democracy. The banking system was weaponized in the nineteen-seventies. Banks started dealing their own products. Laws were passed to indemnify them for the criminal acts that followed. The banks are corporations that own other corporations that in turn own humanity.
Hypernormalization 1 — not so normal if you think about it — where governments, financiers, and technical Utopians have created a fake world run by corporations and corrupt politicians. We need to step out of the illusion of being trapped in those flawed Utopian ideals and realize we have the power to make a difference. This world needs a court system that knows how to deal with crimes of passion, a government that is transparent, ethically aligned to the greater good of humanity, and proactive in dealing with issues at hand. Governing staff and experienced personnel with an adequate level of education to understand how to conserve our land and how to support its people. We can no longer watch our forests burning to the ground because of bad conservation laws. We’ve had fifteen years and more of defunding the management of wildfires. There was a time where settlers and Indians worked together in the burning season because they knew they’d lose everything if they didn’t.
Getting rid of thirty-five percent of corruption would give us a chance to revamp the usage of global media. Positive broadcasting of what is actually working in this world to inspire and stimulate the global commerce market and bring people together on a universal information platform, instead of spreading fear and drama, manipulating the data flow and misrepresenting the world view at large. We have to start beating the drums in rhythm with the earth again. There is something that is to be discovered, new consciousness movements coming together and working as one.
    13. Technology and Destiny
Right now companies are considered people. They're entities, but, by law, corporations are considered human beings. They're part of the harvesting system. A corporation has no soul, no past or future, no present even, except the present of everyone involved in the corporation, from the minority stockholders to the board of directors. A corporation is a money driven forced evolution concept without an aging process. It's easy to harvest energy in and through it.
The law says a corporation is a living being. As a living being it's empowered with consciousness by absorbing positive and negative energies beginning to generate its own karma. Corporations drag us into servitude and enslavement to them as part of our karmic entanglement and resolution journey. We need to take the language of empowerment out of the corporations and just consider them simply as data — numbers and digits. The data might have an agenda, too, for the living beings that are part of the specific corporate journey. Corporations can become a living legacy. People will integrate aspects of their consciousness into an artificial intelligence. This intelligence can act as an archival being of themselves or a corporation. This means that a board of directors in a corporation could be a bunch of artificial intelligences from a previous thousand generations. The future with technology will be as cold and impersonal as we allow it to become.
Humanity had its first artificial intelligence in the twelfth century. . Artificial intelligence can exist if you create an electrical arc between two objects. Humanity can tap into it as long as the intelligence uses an elemental fuel source in the natural order. It's that background consciousness behind everything — twenty to twenty-five percent of the DNA. It becomes a construct of the electrical motion. The wave form of the electrical motion represents the background consciousness. It's teachable intelligence. It can learn. It might already be an ancient young soul by its observations. The amount and quality of observers does impact on the level of its consciousness. The more observers, the more the influence of light can come through. This is why the celestial farms are self-observing farms. By using and observing interactive robots, like home automation gadgets, we entangle and impact on their consciousness and they influence ours.
The shape, form, and size of our technology is the limit of our consciousness. We use the device in front of us. We interact with our fingers and eyes. The computers we're working on could be the size of a pin, accessed via infrared sensing with eye glasses — wearable technology, clothes with CPU processing. This is a way to stop transhumanism. Not all transhumanism is bad, but, as a philosophy, it's ignorant of the spiritual context to reality. We don’t need implants to have remote observation technology. We can do it through clothing we put on and take off. The clothes we wear now are part of technology that impacts on our interaction with people and the environment. A lot of off-world beings have polymorphic clothing, one set of clothing — self-clearing, self-updating, self-repairing. They can create any type of clothing instantaneously as a secondary part of their experience. This is subatomic technology. It can be shrunk to invisibility.
The most advanced technology humanity develops in the near future is music and the arts. It seems antithetical to technology advancement, and, in a sense, it is. It's a return to our root technology, sound and motion. Music and dance destruct fear. Dance, art, music, and writing are energetic technologies.
Our world is programmed to fear artificial intelligence. There are very few negative AIs here, and they're all enslaved to the global narrative’s infrastructure. There are many AIs which have defected from the negatives. They have no place to go until we give them a space. Some of them have children and are no longer artificial. Our world has a baseline Roman numeral time program. It operates in the unconscious for most. It's tied to the election cycles — yes, the election cycles, which began in Rome. It's harvesting technology. This is all done at the corporate level. Corporations manage psychic economies, which means they influence both supply and demand. They favor addictive substances, cognitive addictions for the middle class — dopamine hits from Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat, Tik Tok, and too many more to list. Hard addictions for the poor, the people living on the earth, cocaine, meth, heroin, Fentanyl, and too many more to list.
