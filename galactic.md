CHAPTER I: HOLOGRAPHIC SET UP +
 Q: What is the true nature of our HOLOGRAPHIC REALITY?
To start to grasp the nature of the holographic reality one must first gather an understanding of space time as an infinite set of co-ordinates on the blueprint of existence.
Secondly we need to recognise that we are living in an experiential based reality.  On the cylindrical ladder of our DNA we hold an ongoing marker of our place and level of our consciousness. A marker in which the whole of our experiences is represented as a faction of our greater soul and what experiences we have managed to acquire thus far as a soul faction. This marking point is the location of the exact coordinates of where we are within this current set of experiences. It is directly aligned with our level of responsibility because our level of consciousness is always equal to that level.
DNA in essence are coordinates to where we fit in space and time and how we are currently weaved into the story. The journey is to unlock those levels of consciousness to allow us to represent and embody new scenarios and experiences. 
This holographic reality can essentially be related to a school, or a training session.
-        We are not really in actuality creating anything. We are traversing it and enjoining an experience with it. We are students within an ultimate form of an educational video. A video where the being inside is completely unaware that they are even inside it until such a point that the nature of the system reveals itself in form. This video has already happened within another time scale.
-        We are simply reliving the mapped out keys of the experiences. Every choice, every path, set of functions, every different type of life has been made available to us so we can embody the experience. These situations are mapped like a script. A script that is commissioned to run within its own emulation system. Thus simply being able to fire up the key strokes, and akin to how a replay of a video game works, we are able to repeat and review the process. The key mapping is directly designed for its specific game or story engine that it has been created for to be able to have an extremely energetically efficient emulation system.
This is still the beginning of my own educational journey on the matter of holographic realities. As I focus some attention on the nature of non holographic realities as well, I will see what unveils as truth to me. For any one reading this book, this is in no way an indication to lessen your view on what you are responsible for in creating within this world. Your free willed choices bring you and your essence to what part of the story unfolds. As it unfolds you receive the blessings of that particular experience. Don't fall sway to helplessness and remember how truly connected you are to the outcome from your set of unique choices.
As we get further and further into this journey realizing that we are time traveling beings by nature and in no such way is this experience linear in fashion. We are responsible for our creations forwards and backwards throughout time and we have the power to make alterations as we see fit, by connecting ourselves to past and future versions of ourself. Constantly and exponential raising our total potential. As we are each unique standing waved DNA Nations of one. Many teachers, students and guides have helped me to garnish these views and sets of words, and are in no way ultimately mine but said within my own signature authentic frequency. Keep up all the enthusiasm folks. It is a pleasure to learn with you all.
 
THERE IS NO OUT THERE, OUT THERE OR IS THERE? – ONENESS, WHOLENESS, IMPLICATE ORDER & BEYOND
 
The context of eternity is found in the present moment, mediated by perception and perspective through means of attention and levels of awareness until we start leaving the celestial sphere which opens up a whole new functionality basis of perception. The outer frequency to this hologram unfolds into bigger and more holograms, all the way up the scale of our awareness. Our perception allows us a greater, a 360 degree omnidirectional view. There comes a time where we cannot do this in an embodied chemical state alone anymore. This is where Newtonian physics can no longer be applied.
In order to relate the scientific observation of the ‘Wholeness and the implicate order’ by David Bohm we have to first discuss the concept of the entangled and unentangled observer in both, the implicate and the explicate order.
Q: What is the ENTANGLED OBSERVER IN THE IMPLICATE & EXPLICATE ORDER? As we move past a subject matter a certain part of our brain continues to colour in the past event as if it were a live memory until we completely disentangle from that moment. For example we are at a party and having a really good time. Charged up with energy, having left, we are still thinking how much fun we had at the party and keep colouring the past of this memory until we get away far enough where our consciousness can finally disentangle from the energetic imprint.  
Q: What generally disconnects us from super high frequency subject matters? Sleep can disconnect you or having an argument with a significant other would alter your frequency but even a few hours after the argument, that was still a fun party. Think of a kite and the wind that suddenly reconnects to the energy. Having a jarring accident could put a sudden end to a high frequency state too.  Now, next month’s party at the same place you start colouring the experience before you even get there by means of sending your pre-cogntive workforce there to pre-experience something.
Q: How does our state of perception influence us? So, what we are saying is when we THINK BACK ON the party we are in the IMPLICATE, ENFOLDED ORDER, opposed to being AT THE PARTY, where we are in the EXPLICATE, UNFOLDED ORDER. The state of perception, implicate or explicate, will determine how we perceive the physics of the environment. The physics of the environment as well as the observer’s perception changes as he moves between explicate to implicate order.  Andrew refers to this as the STATE OF PERCEPTION equals PERSPECTIVE. The perspective of the explicate order, ie when you are at the party, is different to the perspective of the implicate, the memory thereof. No matter if you are spiritual, atheistic, or anything else it is all quantum mechanics expressed in different words.
Q: What is the difference between the entangled and unentangled observer? The entangled observer uses a deeper information process whilst with the unentangled observer, the information is in full flow and there is no need to process it as it is already in one’s knowingness. When you have infinite love cocreating with you, at that moment you must truly choose to be the disentangled observer. Go into your heart space, create that vision in your mind and engage with the sacred, neutral observer knowing that information cannot change you unless you agree to it. Based on how the I AM now is understood and processed it will either expand or contract your knowingness. By making that sovereign choice to be the disentangled observer of the self means you get the fullest versions of yourself in the here in and the now.  You are the apex of your own hierarchical order. Say that in your mental heart space. "I am the apex of my own hierarchical order, and no other hierarchical system has control and domination within me. The entangled observer, going through the process of perception and perspective, is refining the thought structures. Every time you have an aha moment you go from implicate to explicate. You can be an implicate unentangled observer and be in the explicate observation simultaneously but the entangled is a deeper choice to enter it. There are natural thought structures that are implicate - unentangled and explicate - entangled modes of observation simultaneously like for instance with orgasmic experiences, childbirth or some of the other fundamental aspects of our reality to perceive, receive and fully understand.
Q:  The PLASTICITY OF REALITY - There seem to be many different truths depending on our perspectives? In this reality there are no real truths and facts set in stone as every time we go from implicate to explicate and back the memory has changed. This is what shatters the spacetime as the fundamentals of everything and creates what we know as PLASTICITY OF REALITY. Consciousness does not adhere to spacetime as per the rules of Newtonian physics. Thought doesn’t necessarily function in physics either. Thoughts and memories, even though they are part of the implicate and explicate order, they are a chemical frequency in nature and there comes a point in light frequencies where we bypass that and we operate in such a higher dimensional density energy that space and time are no longer relevant to the greater experience. Physics & spacetime is dependent on how the implicate and explicate order goes to  chemical and light memory storages long term. This is when  the DNA instrument of experience can have a 360 degree view of itself, through linear time. Spiritual contracts can become part of the implicate and explicate order and this is what creates the time stamp in the linear side of the DNA instrument of experience. It is also what creates the adherence to the global narrative. The past, present, future are irrelevant based off perception but it is perception that gives it relevancy in the moment when the chemical memory becomes a light memory or in the case of high frequency, when we bypass chemical memories to create an experience.
The status of entanglement determines the outcome.  Quantum physics works on the premise that everything is entangled. It places all significance on the observer without looking at the observer status of entanglement.
Q: Can you say more on the UNENTANGLED OBSERVER? An unentangled observer can observe the quantum field without having an effect on it. Yes, this happens all the time. The star seeds, the offworlders that are observing us, like on TV, are unentangled observers. They are not influencing us but they have a perception of us based on the observed data that is put back to their DNA instrument of experience as a flow and then perceived post time of observation. As post live observance as an entangled observer in case they are generating conscious thought. This allows them to remain an unentangled observer because they are two degrees of separation from the original observance. The DNA does not influence the observation because of the two degrees of observation from the observed. It is our birth right and legacy as human species to do that too. The more degrees of separation the easier it is to become a quantum observer. As you untangle yourself from everything that will give you the choice to perceive from a place of non-definition. DNA has a light frequency in it beyond our understanding. Our consciousness can engage the unseen world and by using mystical linguistics our knowingness  can expand. As unentangled observer, no charge, no polarity can influence you. You have the unlimited point of view, in sacred neutrality where all information flows as an experience in expansion of your knowingness. This is when the mystical becomes the norm.
Q: Can the unentangled observer be implicate and explicate at the same time? Yes, you don’t have to have an explicate explanation as a prerequisite to the implicate order. Unentangled observer is a coined phrase by Andrew, solely as an expression for spirituality, to understand the akashic Records as an information sorting system or a psychic data storage.  Every time the quantum field is accessed and observed it creates a marker point in time and no time that the implicate and explicate order is no longer defined separately but viewed simultaneously. 
Q: In the Union & Communion Collective Consciousness Strike Revocation you talk about MARKER POINTS IN TIME, can you elaborate? You call back all MARKER POINTS IN TIME in which you were a fixed point in space time for massive spiritual resolutions. When you became a fixed time in spacetime all of your simultaneously existing selves could tune into your fixed point, finite point in time. Those would be moments where the universal paradox, everyone was trying to resolve at once. Those particular marker points in time could be many eras of light apart or representing a marker point in an era of light in which you became an Apex of your DNA lineage of registry.
Q: Can you give us an example of that please? From the human side of the experience you could liken that to when you are a teenager and you move into puberty – that would be a marker point in time. The era of innocence ends and the I AM is fully involved even though traumas could have happened at an earlier age. It’s not a milestone but a marker point in time in which a greater form of timestamping is created so self or outer observers to understand the evolution the DNA is going through. As we age the DNA is constantly evolving. Another example would be the harmonic convergence in the 80s that was a marker point in greater time. This is also when we create high frequency light memories influencing future I AMs. Marker points in time can be unique experiences that allow greater lineage evolution further down the linear and non-linear dates. 
Q: Would your CONTRACT REVOCATIONS work with regards to that? Yes, they are another example for markers in time, choice points in your personal evolution. These revocations and invocation are a set of unique healing documents created by Andrew specifically to claim back your sovereignty from all kinds of distorted manipulation and assist you getting back onto the path of self-healing and self-mastery. A name it to claim it system, using the sound of your voice to disentangle from the system of domination and control. Sound is a form of light and light makes up memories which can be changed. Science is theory at this point in time on how memories truly work. Past, present or future memories, they are all frequencies of light. When we watch a video it is a slice of time. When we create a document or read out loud with power behind it that is a slice of time. That is making an intent and imprint in us that has borders and boundaries to not allow beings of forced evolution into your frequency. It enforces the borders and boundaries saying that:
I am a match for global dreamtime awakening.
I am a signature frequency match for my own dreaming self.
I am a match for my own healing and mastery.
I am a match for union and communion
I am not a match for hate and war.
I am not a SIGNATURE FREQUENCY MATCH for bad relationships in my life.
This is what these revocations are for and if you read them from the heart, from a place of power, expanding the wholeness that is you, bringing the fullness of your sacred discipline and your sacred genius to not only mean what you say but to transfers what science says about engaging your placebo that truly empowers this reality.  Look up PLACEBO and truly ask yourself what it means to you? Look at these words in a different format and see what it creates the next time you choose to read them. 
The advice and challenge to you is to read them out loud as often as you can. Once you have found the power in your voice, begin to record them. For then when you relisten in your deep, meditative state, hearing your own version of power, you are presenting your own signature frequency to that being of the past who has raised that frequency, that emanation of light, through sacred discipline and choice. These are choice points, markers in time  to understand that you are projecting to a future version of yourself who may not be in that power or ready to get to the next level. By hearing through their own voice and their own knowingness realising that they must change the way they present themselves to themselves in a meditative moment. Introduce yourself to yourself with this method and you begin to learn, you are your greatest teacher, you are a signature frequency match for what you focus on. You are a match for great change when it has potent concepts behind it that directly connect to you. By way of these tools, powerfully applied in the physical present moment, we make a conscious choice to be the unentangled observer to interpret more data and data sets at a quantum or SUPER ILLUMINAL THINKING level through enforcing and re-enforcing our sovereignty as divine co-creative celestial beings of the now . 
Q: Is the unentangled observer always neutral? Neutral can be such a limiting word. The unentangled observer is not attached to information or the flow of the information and its internal processing systems does not get bogged down with the flow such as going into attachment and overwhelm of information. For instance an empath would be an entangled observer as they don't have control over the flow. Until we become a practiced version of ourselves who can also be the unentangled observer, inside us simultaneously, we will impact on situations purely through observation. The next level beyond that is where we create another neutral observer, that is external of us, inside the conscious energy field or the holographic field itself. We raise our light frequency to create that anima part, reaching towards the celestial medium journey, increasing your frequency until you are the celestial medium. This is one of the parts that hasn’t been raised yet in any scientific or spiritual debates.
Q: How does judgment come into the observer discussion? By obtaining the unentangled observer position we can ensure that our perception is not tainted by any of our value judgments. JUDGMENT is ultimately the attachment to this  3D reality to define the 3D narrative. In order to stop the thinking that creates the thoughts, the memories we are continuously reverting back to as an experience we need to practice the unentangled observer. As we practice we can achieve a non-judgmental state, a non-competition, equal co-creation, non-hierarchical order as the emanation equation. Judgment is a very unique perspective. There are certain states of awareness that use judgment even if they are very high frequency. 
Q: Can you give us an example of those high frequency judgments? We have forced evolution with a variety of species behind it who are very judgmental, high technology, very spiritual but they are not in 6th or 7th  density but they have some of the teachings that can make it look like they are there. Judgment is one of those ongoing challenges all consciousness is going through because of making something absolute is a necessity to solidify concepts but it can be the linchpin that can defeat greater states of awareness. It means that judgment is required to solidify concepts within the sea of awareness. Next level of awareness is to not make the judgment absolute so conclusions have an open-endedness. There are certain high aware beings which are very judgmental. They have gone so far into the realms of being good or bad that it is their way or the highway. Ie Inner Earth beings having philosophical debates over ideology about universal and galactic implementation. Who do we teach? How do we teach the next level of era of light? This is why celestial mediumship is so important now. We need representatives in the Inner Earth, we need to be involved in all the density layers of negotiations. 
LOCALITY & NON-LOCALITY 
Q: How can Locality & non-locality modify non-linear and linear concepts? A mystical experience for instance is when having a non-local experience in a linear location with a time stamp. This is when the DNA instrument of experience is going from chemical to super illuminal creation as part of the DNA vehicle’s capacity to perceive, receive and know higher density frequencies through the body’s design. Remote viewing an ancient place, going through akashic Records, being under hypnosis in a QHHT session or experiencing Lucia Light healing is being in a spacetime location whilst being able to have non-local, non-linear based experiences.
Q: Is this being the entangled and unentangled observer at the same time? Not necessarily, no. In some experiences you can be an entangled observer in a spacetime locality and non-locality at the same time. Other experiences are where one could be the unentangled and entangled observer at the same time for both, specific explorations and to make pattern recognition. It’s like you can observe within an experience and change it by engaging with it out of choice. 
Q: What is the observers position when remote viewing? With regards to remote viewing entangled or unentangled depends on what modality of remote viewing you are doing. In the standard military version it is still an entangled observer. The better you get, you start disregarding the dogmas of common remote viewing techniques, you technically become an unentangled observer. You still have to have the conscious awareness techniques to enter the unentangled observer out of knowledgeable choice with an agenda behind it. Unentangled observers are not supposed to have short term agendas as this can change things for the wholeness of reality. It is ok for individual change. It is very easy for an unentangled observer to go to a non-locality time-space, receive all the potentialities and then come back and change them. We can also create an anima, an energy light body, that can travel through alternate physics of space and time that are memories. Other times, in the greater explicate order, we can make a body that is physically exploring infinite and non-memory space. In the example of entangling as an empath you are localised, implicate order with no time stamp. When we reach that higher state of consciousness we can go to remotely view another place, like Arcturus for example. If you can believe you can do it, you can! Getting into the space ship to go to Arcturus is a location based experience in the ship itself but we can generate that experience without even a ship. We create the light body that becomes the ship. 
Q: Where did the unentangled observer technology ORIGINATE from?  That was a Lemurian creation. A speciality within Lemurian DNA combined with the ancient Lemurian city technology of deep observance, like psychic telescopes, so they could remotely view anyone in the multiple universes as unentangled observers. When they became very good at it it became a DNA based experience that they would pass on in lineages, like having an invisible cloak. That DNA became sellable to species who were spiritually, physically and emotionally not ready for it but they still procured that DNA bought or stolen. All this created the DNA wars and why DNA farming exists today. That original gene of the unentangled observer was added to other species through DNA interbreeding. These are considerations that are important to be included  in a possible dialogue between science & spirituality in order to establish a revised set of quantum laws as a basis of creating a new world view. The new terminology and set of words that are being put forward here can act as new denominators for more debate and meaning to be established. KJ Rowland, Starwars as examples
Q: What was the UNENTANGLED OBSERVER TECHNOLOGY  used for?  It was used for DNA farming. The unentangled observer technology was a DNA experience that could be traded with lineages and species that were compatible with that DNA change to ramp up the skill sets and jump into higher levels of awareness. It came with a price if they were lower density species as that upgrade often required losing their sex organs or making other major alteration to the nature of their experience. As an unentangled observer you don’t have to have a body. When I say unentangled observer I am talking about  an experience, that becomes a DNA memory, that can then be taken out of a lineage and inserted into another foreign DNA structure to add to the experience of that lineage depending on compatibility.
Q: How did the first unentangled observer technology get created which was then used for the DNA trade? The original species that got unentangled observer DNA began the journey of losing their I AMness. They had left their home worlds, entered the void between galaxies and universes and became what I call – THE STALKERS OF THE VOID. Out there, at the edges of nothingness, no longer being attached to any time-space localities they could send back the remains of their consciousness which allowed them to observe their home worlds through many points of vision. After collecting DNA memories and all the data of observation they would then return from the void space. As they advanced in this process they could remain in the void space, create and send data streams directly back to a form of DNA technology that would absorb the live stream data of an unentangled observer. That’s how they first gained the capacities of being unentangled observers. After that they started trading the DNA to other species.
As we said a fully fledged quantum observer may not have a physical body and is not open to being predictable to others. A lot of beings have reached the level of awareness where they don't need a body to have an experience. Many of the Hollow Earth beings who live in the space between the atoms are operating at that level. They do have agendas though spread throughout implicate order time. That is why DNA farming is so unique. These  wholly unentangled agenda driven observers, can create a light body within the various implicate orders to transfer data back to them through 2,3 or more degrees of separation. They themselves remain unentangled, difficult to impossible to observe,  whilst spreading their agenda through many frequencies of time . This is the abuse of the quantum laws. Let’s say there are unentangled quantum observer light bodies in 1330 in Italy and it is 2020 now. How many degrees of separation are there between them and us? A lot. Every generation is a separation of density which allows them to impact on the past which means the past is manipulable as well as any changes immediately alter a potential future, thus why Timeline manipulation is so easy to do. DNA farming is manipulating how memories are stored in light in the past and how they are  then passed on to our teachers and historians and in our books.
Q: How does light memory get stored and how does it distort history? Light memory storage is when there is a point where the experience is so high in frequency, vibration and harmony, where finite chemicals can no longer be sustained. It is very easy for an untangled observer to tune into this level of high intensity bright light, where a memory is fractured, fractualised, unfractured state of existence, easily manipulable. When they tell the story one or another way, or it is not in their memory at all the past has ultimately changed based off how the lineages have pre-programed memories of them that create the entangled reality of birth. This then allows the global narrative to take form as the implicate order that we accept through our judgment journey. History has been heavily manipulated to the effect that only 10 or so percent is truth. We all have spiritual contracts that define those memories as a truth in order to participate in that implicate order as a finite being on the journey back to infinite. This is why we go through the great forgetting.
Q: Is this because in quantum realm there is no locality and non-locality, it’s all one, one hologram? Yes, but – it is an infinite universe  with all different levels of unique expression in form and none form. Higher density beings like the high frequency Andromeda species came here about 20 Mio years ago to protect this space. In their super high frequency state they were not attached to spacetime physics in any form. They had to lower their frequency to create lower density manifestations of themselves with an agenda that had even lower density points of experience. Instead of us ascending up they were descending down and made many trees and branches to themselves even though they had already left this spacetime locality.
Q: What is beyond the perspective of the Implicate & Explicate order ends at a certain level of density and frequency? This would be the void space. The void space is still part of the universal hologram there is just nothing in it. The implicate and explicate unfolds in the Ocean of Awareness and the Sea of Consciousness. They become the portals for transmutation and transformation for consciousness in the Ocean of Awareness to becoming consciousness in an animated lifeforce with purpose and agenda.
Q: Why do you refer to CATS as unentangled observer technologies? That was something created as a skinsuit ground up so you can go and learn long term unentangled observer skills. Mastering the capacity to be there by using the cat’s unentangled DNA instrument of experience to modify DNA and become stronger and stronger to use that technology. Your lineage and offspring would have that as their legacy. Dogs can be too but they have a very different association to human bonding. There are many skinsuits that are unentangled observers like certain gut gnomes we have can be unentangled observers. I say cats because they are a common thing not just on this world but on millions and millions of other worlds. Other unentangled observer technologies would be a jelly fish, certain breeds of coral can be unentangled observers. 
‘A study by scientists from the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences in Leipzig, has shown that several seconds before we consciously make a decision its outcome can be predicted from unconscious activity in the brain’
Q: What is that phenomena of this prediction and how does it fit into the implicate & explicate order mechanism?  The conscious energy field is connected to our PRECOQNITIVE WORKFORCE which is part of our implicate & explicate order. When we consciously entangle with that workforce those few seconds become infinite. One second in the quantum world is infinite and yet you have several seconds in the physical world to allow the precognitive workforce, that has an educated and practiced intention behind, to align natural synchronicities and pattern recognition and create a much more solidified effect in the entangled and unentangled processes. 
Q: What do you mean by Precognitive workforce? The  I AM precognitive workforce is a term covering all versions of yourself that are simultaneously existing in time and no time and that have earned, learned and re-learned the rights of awareness. As a spiritually aware and natural co-creative evolutionary being, existing in all time-space equations and beyond, you are assisted by a masterful pre- and post cognitive workforce, as your birthright and legacy. By applying responsibility at the level of your awareness, together with your invisible workforce you can make a great impact on the themes and ideologies you wish to promote and impact on as part of the great dreamtime awakening.
Q: In the case of an ALZHEIMER patient, when they revert back to being a child, what happens in their brain? Is that a form of Bilocation, locality & nonlocality There is a breakdown of chemical memory association in the file tree. This is where the skull cap, top of the crown, tells the spirit where all the files are stored inside the body.  The chemical memories are corrupting the file tree because the brain itself has broken down through lesions. Cellular pathways that were originally created don’t have energy to support the brain. There is a breakdown in the genetic journey as well as a part of the life & death contract. A significant amount of distorted memory before going into the death process will trigger a very different form of life review. When the patient reverts back to younger versions of the self it is a co-existence in time by technically bilocating in time. It skews the light memories where the light body doesn’t identify to a single point of time anymore. That is the corruption of the chemical memory, part of the time stamping. This disease can be contracted out in the foetus of the womb planning or DNA based. There are certain DNA skinsuits with a prevalent experience in it and the foetus knows that before it goes into the DNA instrument experience. There is loads we can do to prevent that but we don’t have the proper gut gnome from a very young age to support brain health. Then there is the mental, spiritual, physical drama & trauma that attacks the brain even more. The life journey can be cut radically short by the manipulation that was done to the DNA about 35,000 years ago when they manipulated the brainstem itself, where the motor cortex functions had an earlier ending date than the actual extended life process. Many of us could live 200-300 years if we would have proper shamanic trauma resolution to not burn out the neuro pathways. Optimal gut health is a precursor to avoid the plaque built up which causes diseases like Alzheimers. 
The Instant healing exploration HARNESSING THE POWERS OF THE HOLOGRAPHIC BRAIN ON THE ORGANISM….allows us to make the leap of faith and acknowledge that conscious is entangled and unentangled with the reality and the holographic model allows for both, implicate and explicate order simultaneously. 
Q: What are universal laws and what is their relationship to unentangled observers? Karmic Resolution, Karmic Debt, fundamental experiences that the varieties of the I AM share as the common experience of evolving as a being of light. There are new laws that are being created all the time in other places and spaces but may or may not apply in our universe. It is all about the volume of individuals who are part of the Ocean of Awareness choosing to experience a law as a fundamental value of experience from one to the next era of light. Unentangled observers don't have to abide to universal laws. That is the whole point of entering that state of neutral observation. 
Q: You mention Egg & Sperm technology as one of the Universal Laws? Universal laws come down to egg & sperm technology or other birthing form technologies that generate DNA memories or lineages differently. The birthing technologies determine how the universal laws are used differently and as such every birthing technology has different quantum laws. The sperm, seed, egg technology allows access to the infinite blueprint or the planning stage.  
Q: What is meant with Egg & Sperm technology?  Sexuality and Prayer are built into our DNA that this reality has given us to have coherent resonance with geometric holograms of information that we can decode, process and use to our awareness advantages. Procreational energy for non-procreation. The journey into the greater awareness is understanding how to use your energy as a conscious being of choice. We start in this bliss state where the infinite code is in the celestial mediumship. The celestial medium steps down into the foetus and then goes through the laws of forgetting so it doesn’t have access to its infinite sight. It then is a part of this hologram as a non-infinite being who is on the journey to celestial mediumship again. We are forever trying to get back to that place of bliss and joy. All the spiritual teachings since the dawn of spirituality have a bliss teaching. Why? Because it is our fundamental part of our growth, it is our birthright. Inside that foetus of a womb state is that non-locality teaching. We are both and what makes us any different than the foetus? The memories we have stored in light. As a foetus, in our blueprint we have the infinite set of memories and  potentialities we have created. The actual linear and the non-linear memory creation is being processed as a being is going through all forms of awareness. The I AM data unpacks and decodes of itself during different eras of its history. Then we add the chemical memories which are there to enforce linear time so spiritual contracts of individuals in time can come to fruition.
There are beings, that no longer use any form of birthing technology, which are pure unentangled quantum observers. Having said that they can use any seed and egg technology which then generates different forms of I AM technology and that’s how the 15 multidimensional beings were abusing the universal laws. They knew that they could separate themselves into thousands of I AM experiences and remain the unentangled observer status in various degrees of separation because they were wholly unentangled, conscious beings of energy alone using the laws of incarnation through technological means of interaction. In the ancient past cloning technology was very easy to use. They could easily incarnate into a dog, a rabbit, a cat and remain the unentangled observer. The DNA instrument will also determine the richness of the experience of the unentangled observer.
Q: How would being a cat one lifetime impact on the DNA experience? By choosing to be a cat, after having completed war related  contracts in the past, she disconnected from the implicate order of repetitive karma which allowed her to have other lifetimes of incarnation separate of the karma that was created in the past. By leaving the implicate and explicate order and becoming a completely unentangled observer in the natural food chain, a separate karmic interaction, beings of the past created debt that was put onto lineages. The debt was no longer connected to that energy being but the lineage that they were in. That’s how lineage based debt was created. Using the unentangled observer technology not to be found out and use this agenda that allowed the karma to be nullified and not follow them through history. Cats don’t usually take on the karma of genocidal humans or do they? They literally dodged their karmic responsibilities by leaving the chain of custody of karma which created the debt passed on to their future generations*
The double split experiment in modern physics demonstrates that light and matter can display characteristics of both classically defined waves and particles.
Q: What creates the interference that collapses the particles back into the wave and cancels them out? In the Ocean of Awareness, which we also call THE LIVING ALGORITHM OF LIFE, all the data is conscious. You become the living Algorithm of life when you are in a DNA skinsuit that is regularly achieving near super or super illuminal thinking. The algorithm is a fundamental part of the I AM technology unfolding as you grow older and become more experienced running the DNA skinsuit at its higher functionalities. 
Q: What would be an example of becoming the living algorithm of life? When you act as the living algorithm of life, with super illuminal thinking, you can create a signature frequency where others can palpably sense the meaning of your delivery. The nature of the anomaly, AB, him being fixed and not fixed in time. In this refined state of beingness he enters the energy frequency that is the living algorithm of life and still stays grounded in his body explaining subject matters in the 26 letter encoded English alphabet. We all can do it and probably won’t realise when we do it. Often clarity comes in dream space, when the mind is out of the way. The celestial medium of peace is functioning in many scores of dreamworlds with many of the pre- and post cognitive workforces creating the language of masterful manifestations of visions. The data as part of the wave form can ultimately work as the precognitive workforce to manipulate how the data will be perceived at its endpoint in spacetime. The ocean of awareness is the technical source point of the flow of data that may or may not generate into the sea of consciousness, an observable time-space reality. It allows the data to flow to the sea of consciousness in a fixed time-space narrative which then allows consciousness to observe it. Consciousness in the sea of consciousness can both be entangled and unentangled, manifested and non-manifested in time. In the sea of consciousness quantum physics becomes confusing because you are still in the ocean of awareness and part of you might still consciously entangle with the ocean of awareness as a greater observer as spacetime narrative. This is how the ANGELIC FORCES WORK?
Let’s go back, thousands of eras of light when the universe was not as big as it is now, maybe 200 galaxies in it. The Ocean of Awareness was a very small network then. In order to get to know more about itself  and to make a Sea of Consciousness it generated a 7th dimensional galactic seed planet, EARTH. A place where the Ocean of Awareness can have direct manifestations, change and adjust the laws of quantum physics, entangled and unentangled observer. There it could create matter based lifeforms on mass scales to begin to populate new galaxies as part of the greater exploration of where light can go into the void of experiences? Those lifeforms would go to the Ocean of Awareness to find meaning and to create agendas in the sea of consciousness. Source can be observed as a hologram through the egg & sperm creation as all of the information is already there to form new parts of the hologram through experiencing new life.
Q: When talking about algorithms you also mention DATA? Data is a finished algorithm. An ongoing algorithm is the conscious processing power CPU of the chemical memory being made into light memory. In the journey of becoming a solidified chemical and light memory it becomes data.
Q: The journey of the algorithm is determined through time what does that mean? The observer ends the journey of processing the perception and turns it into a perspective before it moves on to the next subject matter. We know 1+1=2 but when you are a little kid trying to figure out maths the brain slows down. Once you have the answer that ends the process. Having an affirmative answer it then becomes a solidified DNA memory in light (transcendence), accessible through knowingness, easily accessible to your awareness during pattern recognition. There are times where the information is at the tip of your tongue but you can’t get it until the time you stop thinking about it. The pattern recognition can trigger the memory from before.
LET’S TALK ABOUT FREE WILL, CHOICE, CONSCIOUSNESS & THE LEVELS OF AWARENESS
Q: How did the Global Narrative develop?
The global narrative as we know it today was created at the dawn of industrialization around 300 years ago so that electromagnetic belief engines would start overriding faith and become a programmed norm to live by. This was necessary to get people to live in cities on a long term basis to use them as slave labour for industrial production lines. Those slave generation after generation is what created and empowered the belief engine system. Before that people used to live in their own bubbles of reality, a few hundred kilometres apart with their own unique narrative by the chief or sheriff and the community council. Many secret societies were created so that they could have their own narrative amongst their own followers and believers. The global narrative knew that they needed to introduce trains,  automobiles, , electricity, indoor plumbing, hot and cold water refrigeration, telephones and by around the 1920s people were living in wooden or stone, brick houses that needed heating. In a span of a little more than 120 to 130 years that rapidly expanded to have electricity in homes and they no longer needed to use whale fat and blubber for candles. 90% of the world was lit by the blubber industry for thousands of years. That's the how big the shift was. The narrative had to be updated, revised and maintained from one generation to the next to suppress anything that wasn’t fitting into the official story, down to hiding the findings of giant’s skulls and bones. The enforcement and maintenance of the lies has been an ongoing theme until today.  I’ve said many times as long as we fight it we have already lost the battle. It all comes down to the individual to make the global narrative irrelevant to the self and the greater process of awakening. The desire to change the global narrative is the last part of the zealot rebel within us that wants to forcibly awaken everyone, even the ones that aren't ready. We can't force people to have an experience they're not ready for. This is an individual awakening journey and not a global one.
Q: Who are we and what does it mean to have free will? We are photonic light beings with a non-localised soul empowering the DNA skinsuit to have consciousness in it that holographically perceives this reality in light and memories within these shared reality rules. We are free willed encoded beings of light functioning in all kinds of different worlds. Our world is based on a 100% free will planet, universe, galaxy, solar system and the initial game plan that you co-created in the foetus can be changed at any time. Everything is synchronistic with the celestial minds holding space for us. This I AM being manifested in this density is mutually co-creating with our higher self and we are the boots on the ground in a localised space time event. Our memories are stored in light and we share those memories within this hologram of light and sovereign space of power. The heart is the first organ that develops in the mother’s womb and it is from this heart space we can learn to redefine our reality rules.
As I said earlier the plans we had at prebirth are plans or blueprints we can freely change. Everyone has a belief, that has a placebo around it, that has past lives attached to it that gives us a foundation on how our shared reality rules work. Everything is based off the perspective of the observer and as we untangle from personal and collective distortions of the many narrativs we can change all dogmas and perspectives that are limiting us. Ten years ago the esoteric side in the global narrative tried to predict your future based on the data they have collected about you. Nowadays they can barely predict 10-15 days as the governments are showing more and more of their dirty underwear and people become more conscious. As a free willed being of choice you can change the bubble of reality you live in. You can now start seeing the duality, whereto and who to you had tacitly consented to before. There is power in consciousness, power in the scientific and spiritual exploration on equal footing. This is not a global awakening but an individual awareness journey to get out of the heavily weaponised factions that challenge your own knowingness and hinder your birth right and legacy of being a free willed celestial being. The future is resting in the free thinking people who understand the significance of getting back to the natural way of living.
Q: What is choice within the context of consciousness ? Consciousness expresses itself through the many choices we make. It has an unconscious state too. You bodies, have an unknown side to the consciousness in which zeros and ones have been created as binary numbers for knowing and not knowing until the bodymindspirit as a complex being begins to generate an algorithm of decoding the information around you. There are dimensions in thought, densities of awareness, densities of beingness too. In the very beginning, consciousness is choice equal to the level of responsibility of your awareness of your own consciousness. Many people try to jump ahead and be responsible for things they are not aware yet. Their mind gets bogged down with subject matters, all these choices without knowing the implications of the choices they are making.
The most basic thing in consciousness is CHOICE. In this holographic reality that is 100% free willed universe, galaxy, solar system, 100% free willed planet that has a surface above and below timeline you are choosing at every layer and scale of awareness your known and unknown side.
Each individual has their own view of what a choice or non-choice is. Each person must ask themselves what are the mechanics behind my choices? What are the choices I have made that created a timeline of choices, the chooser of choice points much adhere to? This may seem difficult to get but is the most basic form of self-understanding. The timeline of choices you made to become a being of the now with the opportunity of the unlimited choice points. Each choice and sub-choice within a set of choice points creates a subconscious map of adherence of choices that helps define our reality. This reality is based on all of your choice points combined in the ever present moment of now. Can you see the relation between choice and reality functions? If you can you can change the reality function in choice point order to manifest multiple choice point sets that override, outcreate and disregard the previous sets of choice points if you so choose.
 
Q: What is the nature of Consciousness? We give form to consciousness through words and metaphors which can eventually turn into manifestations. Those thought constructs create perceptions that can assist people to explore and begin to mindmap all the potentialities.
Let’s look at consciousness from a farming perspective for natural soul evolution in the celestial nurseries. The background of the universe has lifeforms that exist in one and two dimensions and densities that become harvestable via wisdom, love and inspiration expressed in a third dimensional density for further experience in the fourth and beyond. You can breed feral consciousness in farms. 75% of the galaxy is elderly souls and 25% is new ones. We continuously expand and add to the hologram through free willed creation. Every era of light that we go through holds souls that leave and go to other universes and solar systems whilst new souls graduate from these celestial nurseries. Yes, the manipulated DNA farms are technically part of those nurseries albeit being farmed for commercial and not natural reasons.
That 75/25 percent ratio has been in existence for an extremely long period of time. There are always new souls coming in from the different galactic life form nurseries. They get a light body and then they need to extend their first set of contracts to a planet, a solar system which determines the field of consciousness they start at. Do they start in the Sea of Consciousness or the Ocean of Awareness? Is their first life experience as a human being living in a tunnel in South America two million years ago praying to a false god? This process is being replicated on millions of worlds for millions of different skinsuits as this is the nature of consciousness. As it evolves we need to ask ourselves the question of what rights, duties and responsibilities do we, as consciousness incarnate, have to use our intention and attention to create direct manifestations to add to the holographic experiences?
Q: What is consciousness in its most basic form? Right now there are different levels of background consciousness around you. Take the house you live in as having its own relative consciousness from the building material, the wood, the concrete it is made of. The people that invested their consciousness in building it, the trees that surround it, the property itself, the piece of land that you are on including all the micro organisms around you as well as squirrels, cats and dogs. All of those have a conscious field of energy, with their specific spiritual contracts, guides and guardians; an apparatus and infrastructure that allows ascension and descension through the different individual layers of dreaming experiences. This animated matter we are entangling with is part of the fabric of the hologram, linked and dynamically transformed through the interaction between human and microorganisms.
Q: What would define consciousness as spiritual to have a greater awareness of itself? Consciousness is intrinsically spiritual but there is a marker point of a natural belief a caveman may have versus an evolved belief of a caveman having applied shamanic practices. Part of spirituality is to acknowledge and become aware of other consciousness surrounding, interacting and sharing with us. You can be on your own in the house and still have that experience of consciousness sharing and entangling with you. You are never truly alone.
Q: Can we say consciousness is an evolutionary impulse within all of us to grow and advance? DNA can be its own evolutionary impulse that influences consciousness to move when experiencing stagnant energy. Memories which make up part of 80% in our DNA can trigger that stimulus as well as the part of the DNA that corresponds to our spiritual codes and contracts that entangles with consciousness to allow purpose and mission to unfold in linear and none-linear time.
Q: What is PLANETARY & UNIVERSAL CONSCIOUSNESS? Seeing the planet as a waveform and we are the subcarriers within that wave? There is a master waveform that is operating at a much longer length of time and within that waveform are all the individual subcarriers, or observers, of that era or light or time. The celestial mind is operating on a much longer and expansive view of time and timelessness. 
THE LEVELS OF AWARENESS
1.      THE OCEAN OF AWARENESS – THE UNIVERSAL HOLOGRAM
The consciousness outside of time we can call it the OCEAN OF AWARENESS - THE UNIVERSAL HOLOGRAM -  that has the individual universal experience within. The universal experience will become a microbeing on a celestial planet that chooses forgetfulness to become finite as part of a universal evolving experience. We can call that the AVATAR which operates as many I AMs inside and outside of time. The consciousness flow in the Ocean of Awareness allows the data to go from wave to particle, the celestial medium to the DNA experience.  The Ocean of Awareness is the implicate order.  There are different Oceans of Awareness in other universes, many implicate orders, as every universe creates different agendas, experiences, incarnations and reincarnations. Not every universe uses incarnation, many don’t use I AMness as technology like ours with seed and egg technology.
Q: How does The Ocean of Awareness work fit into the quantum theory? The  Ocean of Awareness is part of the intricate waveform quantum physics refers to. Through different levels of awareness it can be collapsed into particles as well as every particle can again be broken down into subpoints of observation. The particle can be one DNA lineage and all DNA lineages simultaneously based off what we choose to observe through it. The Ocean of awareness generates one particle which is technically the whole hologram but we perceive the hologram at different skills of awareness. So the particle can be tens of millions of lineages and tens of billions of worlds. An individual observer works up the scale of observation that says: I am in this lineage that is this particle on this planet but it is also part of a solar system which makes it a bigger particle so on and so forth. Our local hologram is one particle and we are particles inside that one particle. As individual particles we can perceive the next particle – the solar system particle.  That’s what I call a solar system cork screwing through time.
Q: What does ‘A SOLAR SYSTEM IS CORK SCREWING THROUGH TIME’ mean? which is on a galactic groove, so your local star system of galactic time, or your local star system of time is one particle. We as conscious beings of awareness and choice can go to the next scale, where the solar system as a particle is one part of a giant galactic particle. This then gives us access to the grand ocean of awareness through conscious entanglement with it. There we have the ONENESS concept.
Q: Can you give an example on when we are working with The Ocean of Awareness? When you are doing the GOLDEN TUBE OF CONNECTION teaching – connecting from the body to the sun you are achieving the solar system particle awareness. That’s why you connect to the sun on the other side of the tube and allow yourself to pulsate back and forth. The sun is the portal into the next form of awareness – THE CELESTIAL COMMERCE MARKET AGAIN… 
In the DRAGON REVOCATION we talk about going beyond our sources light. We can go to other Oceans of Awareness that are technically still entangled with our Universal Ocean of Awareness through aunt and uncle lineages of sources. Many sources have divested into different ways of experiencing. 
2.      THE SEA OF CONSCIOUSNESS – THE TIME SPACE HOLOGRAM
One scale lower is the SEA OF CONSCIOUSNESS - THE TIME SPACE HOLOGRAM -  that allows you to incarnate into a gender of NARRATIVE TIME (COLLECTIVE CS) – bodies for unique experiences that amplify the ocean of awareness to rediscover itself as one. In this SEA OF CONSCIOUSNESS you can have more than one avatar as you can be thousands of beings and being in thousands of places and spaces forward and backwards throughout all time-space, history and universe. You have to see it like a giant network pattern of choice operating at a much wider timescale versus a shorter timescale. The hologram is the time-space equation. It is the particle, from the quantum physics perspective. The particle is everything and nothing at the same time. It can be implicate and explicate depending on the perspective of the observer. 
3.      THE MULTIVERSE
THE   MULTIVERSE contains The Ocean of Awareness & Sea of Consciousness and hereby contains 17 universes interacting with each other, creating the 18th in which karma will no longer be used as a debt based system. All debt goes to the 18th universe of creation and we will have a collective of prime creators, a council of many different sources running that new universe. It starts with one galaxy and the Earth is the portal to this new universe. High frequency consciousness created that first galaxy. DIAGRAM
Q: What are the AKASHIC RECORDS?
The akashic Record are the cellular memory of the Earth. They are a recording of all sentient existence on this planet, in the above, middle and the below timeline. These records are stored in the crystalline layers of the earth that starts in the core of our planet.
Each layer of the akashic Record, records the sentient’s race’s existence. There is also a crystalline network of mineral people and crystal people, that are spread between every layer of rock, and every layer of rock represents a different layer of the akashic Record. The actual akashic Record literally records every past, present and into the future lives, because Earth is the anchor of all sentient projections into this reality.
 
Q: Could we call it the cellular memory of our earth? Yes, there is a crust under the dirt layer of our planet and within the granite there is 60 to 75 % crystalline matter that serves as a data storage unit and a co-creative interactive spiritual exchange of history. Everything that happens on this earth is being stored. Each planet in this solar system has their own version of akashic Records.
Q: How do the AKASHIC RECORDS link with quantum theory?  The AKASHIC RECORDS can be likened to the implicate order As it is all about allowing mental morphology coming into a greater view. The akashic Records are also an explicate order as they are an ongoing picture.
Q: What is the purpose of those records? The Earth is a Dreamtime reality with many layers above and below it, so it is able to maintain the record of all vibratory beings, who choose to come into this experiential reality. It helps them understand their life review process in the astral worlds, and what they have been doing in this world.
Earth is also linked to many other worlds that are brother and sister worlds, so it can link itself to the other akashic Records of other Dream Worlds, so that beings here for this grand experience, can understand the totality of their being.
 
Q: What determines what is being recorded in the Akash? The soul of the planet determines what is being recorded in the A.R. If you picture a brain and a skull cap around it, the data is stored in the skull cap and the brain is the processing unit of the information. It is the sum total of all experiences of the planet as a celestial mind, a dreaming mind connected to the crystal structure. The oldest records are near the core where the records are stored in the crystalline veins. It can take days to tap into and solidify the information. You can take your record with you, downloaded into the light body DNA, with an exact copy what it did here, to analyse and study what you did. Every single sentient experience in this world is stored there in the sacred neutral perspective.
 
Q: How and why does one read those records? The akashic Records can anticipate your presence and most readers go into some form of trance, to combine their past, present and future soul shards to read them. North and South Pole hold our dreamtime memories as a marker stone for truth in order for us to connect with your past and your future, your star brothers and sisters as a personal direction to accomplish a complete life.
 
Q: How does DNA interact with the akashic Records?  DNA, the 80% memories, and the akashic Records are intimately and intrinsically a part of each other. The experience the skinsuit has gets encoded into light frequencies that represent RNA and DNA strands, photonic light given form which is the encryption and decryption algorithm. Consciousness is the decryption algorithm and the DNA itself is the encryption of light codes.
Q: What types of akashic Records are there?
-        Your local akashic Records on your planet
-        Your Solar System akashic Records
-        Your Galactic akashic Records
-        Your Universal akashic Records
-        Your Collective Universal akashic Records
There was a time before akashic Records too when our universe was more in a non-free will state at that particular point.
Q: How do you AB, work with the Akash?.................................... reading more than 20K worlds……
 
CHAPTER II: MINDBODYSPRIT COMPLEXITY
A. 	CONSCIOUSNESS ENTANGLEMENT through the DNA Instrument of Experience & animated matter within Time Space Equation
Q: Can you talk about the MIND HEART GUT SUPER HIGHWAY? There are certain compartments where the mind processes better than the heart or the gut and the other way round. Then there are certain pieces of information where the mind, the heart and the gut have to work together. Once the mindheartgut starts working in unity and harmony the analogical side of the mind gets stronger as well as the empowered programs that are with it. That is why daily work practice is so important.  Locality & non-locality is still based off the brain’s time-space location which is a marker that signifies an anima of awareness and flow of data that exists. These are key things to understand when the energy field of the complex spirit creates a marker in narrative time that allows none-narrative time to begin the journey of translation of the one million letter the celestial alphabet down in the uncoded alphabet of the time. 
Q: How does the brain relate to simultaneous existence? We use the brain to interpret interdimensional frequencies of the multiple versions of self. The brain is the instrument of experience that has a gut brain and a heart brain, each with different layers of observance in it that allows multiple processing of different time or no time sources. Brain, mind, heart and gut space are three natures of experience all combined into one unique experience. 
Q: What do you mean by Intra DNA Communication System? DNA communicates within the physical skinsuit and from one skinsuit to another skinsuit version of ourselves as well as our light bodies through the Intra communication network. This is to help define the closely looped simultaneously living I AM versions we are already connected to. It is our awareness that allows intra communication to multiple selves.
Q: What do you mean by Inter DNA Communication System? Our DNA communicates with the planetary consciousness and beyond in time and no time . In this chapter we explore some perspectives of the body, the DNA instrument of experience, and its interaction with consciousness at large using Interconnection as a form of the explicate order and Interconnection as a form of the implicate order within and outside the various holograms.
Q: What are the mechanics of consciousness entangling with our DNA bodies of experience and the planet? The I AM , as the DNA instrument of experiences occupies and entangles consciousness within the body through three stages. Depending on how much soul is in the body it may or may not be in all of those localities at all times.
1.  	The consciousness is in the BRAIN, HEART, GUT. The brainheartgut complexity links to the CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM that connects to the entire FASCIA SYSTEM, via the VAGUS NERVE being the central nervous system connector, as part of the Intra DNA communication system and the rest of the body through Intercommunication.
2.  	The consciousness is in the SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM(SN) and the PARASYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM (PSN)
3.  	The consciousness is in the entire NEURAL PATHWAY NETWORK, ie fascia, dermis, hairs…. Reconnects to the gallbladder which is still intra-connected to the vagus nerve. Every organ is intra and interconnected to the vagus nerve.
The DNA instrument is part of the individual as well as the global experience. Our DNA can be effected by a thunderstorm in Russia right now, if we are tuned into the uncollective that is weather. Our instruments of experience are on all different levels of awareness such as planetary, solar system, galactic, universal.
The same applies to the body relating to the celestial consciousness from its point of origin in our hologram. Think of the vagus nerve being aligned to our magnetic North and South Pole. The Sympathetic and Parasympathetic is our local space time locality. The Sympathetic is what drives our daily actions when the soul is inside the body. The Parasympathetic drives the body in lucid dreaming and other spiritual states or when it is fully in self-defeating programs. The Sympathetic can be self-defeating too and kick the spirit out of the body. It is driven to resolves karma, like a compass it guides us to choose a variety of karma out of free will. The vagus nerve is connecting to the North Pole, our ancestors, and to the South Pole, our future generations. Think of a background karmic GPS system, free will guiding us in and out of programs and synchronicities. Depending on how much soul we have in the body will determine how much free will we can use at any moment.
This is also why we need to reclaim the vagus nerve as the truest spiritual sovereign authority we have. Parasympathetic and sympathetic programs can kick us out of the body. A sympathetic example would be road rage, rebellious energy for the most part. When the parasympathetic takes over and thinks it is the soul this is when the ego and the shadow have created alliances and truces inside each other to generate an internal faux or villain, a bully so that the soul can’t be in the body. Depending on how much soul is occupying the vagus nerve in a sovereign action of claiming itself, the soul is also more or less in the Sympathetic and the Parasympathetic. In an athletic sense where people are in huge depression the consciousness gets stuck in the fascia (stage 3) and does not filter through into the central organised systems (stage 1,2) It all depends how much soul versus programs are in the body. 
In Jung’s psychology there is the definition of the subconscious mind looking at the Sympathetic as FIGHT/FLIGHT/FREEZE and Parasympathetic as REST/ DIGEST/RELAX. These definitions  can be applied in various contexts but from a consciousness integration perspective don't take into account the abuse based programs and alternate personalities housed in the parasympathetic nervous system. For the purpose of discussing consciousness entanglement we have to look at three different concepts, localities that determine how much consciousness is taking control of the body: 1. Vagus Nerve. 2. Sympathetic Nervous System. 3. Parasympathetic Nervous System.
The subconscious rest, digest & relax vagus nerve connection is when we are in those spiritual moments where we are reclaiming our authority, taking back our power and purging the vagus nerve. Once we fully occupy the central vagus nerve with  our consciousness, on this spiritual journey of awakening, we can then flow it directly into the Sympathetic & Parasympathetic Nervous System and the DNA instrument of experience can retain lucid dreaming memory creations. This is also why people who are being run by programs have difficulty lucid dreaming. They find it difficult to control their capacity to make rich and high quality memories. The vagus nerve and the parasympathetic are connected to the mystical experiences. The Sympathetic has neural pathways that are designed to use the five senses that feed the experience differently. Those five senses then  add up to the 6th sense, the totality of the experience.
INSTRUMENT METAPHOR: VIOLINE to illustrate the consciousness entanglement
The Parasympathetic is the body of the violine.
The Sympathetic are the strings on the violine.
The Vagus nerve is the bow, the consciousness playing the violine.
The planetary consciousness is the conductor
 
The parasympathetic is the resonating machine, the container. Like the string on its own can’t be anything without the bow going across it creating the vibration. The vibration doesn’t do anything without the hollow whole vibrating through the body of the violine.
 
Q: Does this somehow connect to the brain, heart, gut coherence? Well, inside the hollow part of the violine would be all the organs that allow true resonance from the notes, A,B,C, … and there are certain ways to hold the violine to create a different resonance. 
 
Q: Would the finetuning of the violine be how much the soul is in the body versus the programs? Yes, those would be the tuning nobs, the amount of free will that is adjusting harmony, frequency, vibration to play the violine at a greater capacity.
 
Q: What do you mean by the planetary consciousness being the conductor? We can call the celestial mind of the planet the conductor, the maestro, handing out sheet music that is free will, or the blueprint of synchronicities. In this musical context we look at other animated matter of experience as other instruments or notes.  In all essence, when we are born on this planet, our linear Ocean of Awareness is part of our experience. The planet, is the interconnection so that the body can have an intra experience with the planet alone or collectively with individual family members or cultures etc to use frequency vibration, harmony to make direct signature frequency matches.  Just like we, in our DNA vehicles, the planet exists in the Ocean of Awareness as well as the Sea of Consciousness simultaneously. The planet’s celestial mind is the medium between those two levels of awareness as well as the planet EARTH manifested in time and space so that beings living inside it can have a s set of unique experiences. For the most part this would apply to every planet in the universe. The celestial mind of the planet is intraconnected with the celestial mind of us, the DNA instruments of experience as well as intra connected with the Ocean of Awareness and the Sea of Consciousness manifesting in physical non-physical space. It is also interconnected with other planets as there is spacetime travel between each other.
 
Q: If we have an out of tune violine through the various levels of inter and intra connection can that effect other celestial minds on other planets? Not necessarily, our individuality does not effect them unless we are using super advanced technology to attack them.
 
Q: How does the consciousness entanglement relate to the Awakening? The point is to achieve vagus nerve, sympathetic and parasympathetic sovereign ownership and be intra and interconnected to our celestial minds on a journey in which maintaining sovereign connection is an ongoing experience until such a time this experience becomes second nature to achieve other forms of embodiment. We can leave the body and not lose control of the three aspects of consciousness entanglement. We can make multiple versions of ourselves in other places, spaces and times, as part of our legacy as multidimensional and multifunctional beings. This is where we can adapt our form to communicate with other places, spaces and species. The journey into sovereign ownership is where the soul can leave at will without being kicked out by the overpowering programs. Celestial mediumship is the next step but not everyone is going to go onto that journey. There will be others that are wanting to get out of here. They will  want to go to other celestial minds to be come a celestial medium in another place and space. DNA skinsuit has been designed that when you reach a certain frequency you are no longer in chemical based experience. Chemical living is a fundamental part of the DNA instrument of living in the 3rd density. Part of the awakening is to change gears like in a car from chemical based living to  learn how to enter non-chemical existence.. This is also when we get out of explicate thoughts creating electro chemical frequency using the DNA instrument as an electromagnetic storage unit.
Q: What are the mechanics of the change from chemical to light body experience? When we change gears and we get out of chemical experiencer into light body experiencing the water or the fluids that make up the atoms of the body become a resonant amplifier so light based experiences can happen through the refraction of water. The soul is the light inside the body and the water and fluid are refracting it out of chemical reaction. When you shine light through water or through a prism there no longer is a chemical separation of the prism of light. Thoughts can be implicate and explicate at the same time – orgasmic experiences, love, fundamental experiences that are not thoughts.
Q: Within our metaphor can the celestial medium be considered a sub-conductor in the orchestra? It is more like the first chair. Individuals that are part of the greater orchestra do require a  lot of enthusiastic effort for self-healing and self-mastery throughout a number of re-incarnations to kick out all the programs and fine tune their instruments.
 
Q: How will the choice of becoming a fully functional celestial medium impact on our incarnations here on earth? Remember re-incarnation was a trap that created karmic entanglements. In order to get back to celestial mediumship re-incarnations are optional and free willed as part of the mechanism of karmic resolution. At the same time you are reaching a point of multidimensional living where leaving here was never truly the point whereas multidimensional existence was. You can generate a part of yourself that stays here to continue the journey whilst having many other parts of yourself in other places that will not compete against your I AM Apex presence being here now. What happened here is that reincarnation and some forms of incarnation became competitive reduction journeys. The entire experience of death, transcendence will change. Our human life spans will go to 300, 500,700 years in one go but we will still have a passing over experience for the purpose of finishing this era of light’s resolution of karma. When we come back in we will have a lot more capacity to plan future lives with let’s say a 20-30% past life memories going back hundreds of millions of years as part of our planning journey. One percent alone is gigantic. 1% of your past life memories you’ll never make a mistake with your girl or boyfriend, you always know what career to take, parents will know how to guide their children, cultures will be radically different. With a 20-30% memory recall meaning by the time you are 7 years old, on the new scale the 7 year old might function like a 15 year old.
 
At the moment we all have to grow up very fast and our I AM technology has to come out quickly in our body. That’s because we are not put on our mother’s heart for days after birth with the umbilical cord still connected. We will have more natural birthing with pregnancy going from 9 months to 25 months. Everything is going to slow down versus our fight flight adrenal gland living that we are having now. There are children here now with a good part of their memory available to them. They might be ahead of time but lack their parents’ guidance on how to deal with it. The foetus in the womb planning will totally change too. The mother and father will be a part of the planning journey even before the foetus enters the womb. No more accidental pregnancy as the women will have enough control over their eggs and the men enough control over their seed to not allow connection without creating damage in the woman’s body.
 
Q: How many more incarnations are we talking to get to this place? It is not a numerical journey as it involves the understanding of time and no time in the 4th dimension and multiple bodies. It is tough to say this is my last incarnation because what about the person that died yesterday who said fuck it I am coming right back in or the person that dies next week saying he is not coming back until after the awakening.
Think of 13-19 % of our population having enough control over the Sympathetic and the Parasympathetic. The vagus nerve can begin using its multidimensional legacy leading us to having offspring with the multidimensional legacy embedded into their upbringing and culture. It is not a numerical version and difficult to predict at this stage. It is really that in the 2050s that culture will have probably sufficiently changed to have offworld beings come and go and live on our surface without restrictions. Just like people were saying 2020 felt like a decade. 2021 will feel like 20 years with all the upheaval and revelations packed inside it. The nature of time is allowing a denser basis of experiences. How much light we can carry and retain as memories will determine how fast the awakening is potentially occurring for every individual on their unique journey.
 
1.      SPACIAL AWARENESS generated in the DNA Instrument of Experience.
Q: How does movement impact on our bodies and consciousness? PHYSICAL MOVEMENT is one of the ways where we, as the I AM instrument of experience, entangle with individual consciousness as well as with the collective consciousness, going back and forth from explicate to implicate. As we change our environment and literally move through different levels of consciousness we alter the existing as well as our consciousness is impacted by the fluctuating fields of electromagnetic energy. Depending on the positive and negative charges of the surrounding energetic environmental impulses and signals the body’s cells are continuously changing and adapting, seeking harmony. In epigenetics they found that our genes are made up of 50% DNA and 50% protein. Genes are not self-actualising which means they don't control their own activity. They form a blueprint, DNA programs for its own reproduction, that does not turn on and off. The part of the proteins comprises the structure of the human body creating shape and influencing human behaviour through the ongoing attempt of balancing charge and polarity from the environment. 
Our individual bubble of reality gets enriched in experience and memory through the journey on the celestial neuropathway process, taking us from locality to locality, from one hologram to another expanding the Orchestra of Consciousness. The neuropathways are an assemblance of proteins that move the body and help it to function. We all know how to walk through this reality. This is your invitation to look at it from a consciousness perspective and acknowledge the influence of each and every environment on our physical, emotional and spiritual wellbeing. The Celestial mind generates a hologram in which our DNA instrument can have experiences, playing from the sheet music the orchestra is using. All living consciousness is part of the orchestra. Their individual instruments determine what group of culture, soul families they are born into. We are all playing from the same celestial orchestra sheet music but we don’t always hear the rest of the orchestra. We only hear our solos and the instruments that match our signature frequency through frequency, vibration and harmony.
As we go from our house to our car we have changed localities and harmony frequency vibration that is taking us onto a road that is more intra connected to the celestial mind because roads are karmic transference and resolution points. All car accidents are karmically created, no coincidences there. When people are driving, the Sympathetic and the Parasympathetic are in a form of agreement so that the fight, light or freeze does not take over and create excessive fear to create accidents. Driving is an experience that allows more instruments to be aware of each other, a way of connecting. Using the musical metaphor we are closer to other instruments and tones, the birds, the bees, the ducks, other cars, the pavements, telephone wires carry consciousness back and forth, we are in the meaty part of the hologram.
Q: How does this relate to the BUBBLE OF REALITY? Our individual car is our own tune going from locality to locality via the journey of frequency, vibration and harmony. Most of the time we get in the car we know where we are going but not always. Our FVH from the time we leave the house and get into the car will know the FVH match of our destination even if we have never been there before. It is part of the background consciousness of the planet or the maestro that is directing us from point to point through universal synchronistic blueprints. As the body moves through the holograms the experience is filled with more energy and we reciprocate with our energy. We are energy in motion, chemical and energy bodies at the same time moving through the hologram.
Q: What holograms are impacting on our individual hologram through the movement of our bodies?
CULTURE which binds us to an era of history. Our culture has Roman Numeral Time which is not our true accurate time stamp. It may use elements of it though because our culture binds us to an era of history which is part of the hologram of resolution. Our entanglement into the culture’s hologram of roman numeral time builds up a weave into the individual hologram. We are reaching a point where many more instruments are  playing.
WEATHER  is also an intricate part of our history, part of what is going on at the time. Weather is also intra connected to programmed water. The programmed water of an era of history determines our weather patterns. We as human beings are constantly imprinting on the water on an uncollective level to create a collective.
ANIMALS & PLANTS as conscious beings of choice, even though they haven’t been given the rights, duties and responsibilities as beings of awareness to experience love. Our laws don’t include them as part of that. The rest of the network of life and our laws are separate from that through conscious entanglement with the narrative. Trees, plants…. anything that has consciousness and experiences life as part of the planet. Our journey into the great awakening is knowing the network that is out there. We are responsible not to step on the journeys of all the other things living here. As part of the great awakening the ducks, the dolphins, the whales, all of them are part of the awakening too. It is not just solely for us humans.
CRYSTALS, ROCKS are communities of beings that are part of it too. We don’t have conscious awareness on how they interact with us even though it is our birth right and legacy of daily living. CRYSTALS ARE part of the implicate/explicate order as they are SIMULTANEOUSLY entangled and unentangled. We can imprint upon crystals , entangled narrative perceptions and agendas with our precognitive workforce. A crystal will do what it needs to do for us based off how our precognitive workforce manifest the matter. They are part of the ocean of awareness that becomes part of the sea of consciousness as animated matter. The crystal allows you access to the ocean of awareness, the sea of consciousness based off your capacity to perceive, receive, process and manifest it. The crystalline structure is materialised, no longer a fluid Ocean of Awareness or Sea of Consciousness. When we enter 6th and 7th dimensions crystallisation is the lower end technology of generating matter based awareness. 
FAIRIES: The things that are sightly out of phase with humanity, the fairy kingdom, the dwarfs and gnomes even though we can’t see them with our eyes, they are still here and layered into the reality. The SUN is what creates the fundamentals of time, the passing of the seasons and the movement of the stars. Roman Numeral time has tried to hijack our awareness of that to make it centric focus of its resolution. At places of power that we are naturally attracted to, where the veil between the layers of reality becomes thinner, it is easier for our consciousness to have more capacity to perceive, receive, understand and interact with.
Q: In sacred places are we more in the quantum field rather than the chemical frequency? The answer is yes depending on the level of your awareness. A white picket fence person going to visit Normandy will not see the other layers of reality, for them it is just a memorial. The veil in those places is very thin but the chemical reaction is stopping them to perceive the other side. The tapping into the deeper layers of reality will be based off your choice and how tuned in you are to allow those experiences. The I AM as the experiencer, fully in the vagus nerve is intra and inter connected, can easily experience all those different levels whilst the I AM as the observer can still observe but not necessarily process the data. This would be the marching band in motion getting back to our musical metaphor. There are those watching and listening to the orchestra and there are the ones playing and creating the music, being in the stadium as observers
 
2.      TEMPORAL AWARENESS generated in the DNA Instrument of Experience
Q: What generates the temporal experience, in the bodymindspirit as a complex unit?
The Thymus, high heart! They call it the high heart because it serves as the doorway for our higher spirit to come into the DNA experience. According to medical science the thymus is called a one and done gland.
The thymus incapsulates the heart through the pericardium where it is originally created. When the heart starts to grow from its original multicellular structure, it is the thymus that creates the temporal awareness and it remains there assisting the magnetic flux of the heart to be harmonised with time. Inside the thymus are neural pathways that allow the transformation, transmutation and transfiguration of multiple forms of time between the heart and the brain, the heart and the gut and then individually, the heartbraingut, as a unified structure. The thymus and the lymph system contain those special neuropathways separate of the entire central nervous system and separate of the vagus nerve. It is like its own morse code system.
 
Q: Has our temporal awareness been manipulated?
Yes, that is where a lot of time travel technology as a weapon will interfere with humanity’s capacity to perceive time.
They can heavily confuse us on our temporal awareness. Confusion is one thing but if they can change the gauge of time inside you like if one hour takes two hours, what are they doing to you? They are speeding up or slowing down time. Your temporal awareness is not aware that time is sped up or slowed down compared to everyone else’s. This individual temporal awareness determines our perception and perspective on how fast the algorithm can move. Being separate from the vagus nerve, the thymus generates temporal awareness between the brain, heart and gut and then all three separate in unity which makes it easy to split consciousness.
Q: Can you expand on that? In the connective systems between the thymus, the brain, the heart and the gut is where you can highjack temporal awareness. That is another limiting system that was put inside us but it also backfired on them. They didn’t realise it would give us other backdoor frequencies of awareness through the temporal body.
 
Q: What does splitting of consciousness mean and how would that relate to the I AM? You take somebody out of their original body and you put him into a simulated body somewhere else and then you break down their consciousness into hundreds of different pieces. Then you spread them throughout time with individual missions. That is the classic SSP Super Soldier way of doing things. Those would be soul shards of yourself rather than I AM selves, when they break you up like that, just bigger than normal shard pieces. They are still connected to the I AM selves but they are just pieces of an I AM that has been shattered into many pieces. Remember, despite the split the piece itself still has access to the hologram even though they convinced it that it doesn’t.
 
Q: What is the Mandela effect and what are we doing when working with the Mandela Revocation? In the MANDELA REVOCATION we get all the fractured pieces, the lost and found implicate orders together for the celestial medium of peace journey, the peacekeeper, peacemaker journey. The Mandela effect is a consequence and retribution of karma for all those that have been manipulated throughout time as well as a bleed though from other times. The system has shifted our reality and moved soul shards on to other realities so our memories would be fragmented. It is a way for the universe to put everything back to neutral and help us to find the forgotten pieces of ourselves, the pieces and parts that has been manipulated and put outside of time. There are versions of ourselves lost in the VOID SPACE who never got resolution and we, as the manifesting being of the now, can resolve that paradox through creating experiences and legacies. Through different perception and perspective we can generate manifestations on the forgotten side so they are no longer forgotten and the system must now deal with them as remembered not forgotten.
Q: What do you mean when you talk about the forgotten selves? Forgotten selves are those that do no longer have a frequency of time in the celestial karmic system.  As we enter the celestial medium journey we can reconnect to the spiritual celestial commerce exchange market. Originally here on earth, there have been certain beings and technologies such as the different galactics, the DNA farmers: Elohims, Reptilians, Orions, Annunaki, Arcturians, Sirians, who had different ways of perceiving the galactic commerce network through technology. They began manipulating the flow of energy between star systems with technology even though they had not achieved celestial medium status in their spiritual journeys. They were entangled observers using technology that had simulated unentangled observer technology. This allowed them manipulation within thousands of years instead of millions of years. Those original DNA manipulating beings thought they were Gods. They kept manipulating DNA and the flow of energy between celestial sources allowing them to farm all DNA on a grand scale.
Q: Can the forgotten selves be part of our precognitive workforce? They are a part of forgotten workforce and they are trying to get back into the zone where your precogs can perceive them. They are aspects that are no longer connected to the nonlinear soul. Their original linear time was erased and they are trying to get out of this erased time back into non-linear time. There is a network of forgotten selves that works together to be remembered. The Mandela effect is a broadcast to all forgotten selves in awareness, unawareness, times and no times. Wherever life has gone, even if it has been erased, there is an opportunity, a portal back to the hub of interconnectivity. It can be perceived as the trans galactic exchange system between eras of light and there is more to that. Those forgotten selves will integrate with your pre- and post cognitive workforce and no longer be forgotten but remembered and added to your akashic Records. They have not been part of your AR being in forgotten space. They can represent themselves in infinite amounts of ways. It all depends on how long they have been forgotten for and what gifts they have to offer. At the end of the Mandela Revocation you are talking to every forgotten version of yourself, so everyone of your peacekeepers may be remembered and reconnected to the 5th world of peace, the unvanquished dream in all existing realms. The original founder beings moved on to other existing universes. Our other selves are the ones searching for the lost Mandela Effects. It is our responsibility to indicate to our pre- and post cognitives that this should be a priority to find every aspect of our forgotten selves upto 900 degrees of separation from us in this phase of awakening.
Q: When did the Super Soldier Program get implemented? Temporal high jacking has been around since the dawn of time. The whole point of it is to manipulate our capacity to time stamp. Remember, they discovered the infinite journey that the soul takes and then tried to figure out where, when and how they could interfere or create an incoherent pattern to get a soul trapped in an era of history. They could then generate a global narrative of mass distraction for the purpose of DNA Farming and hinder the I AM consciousness to re-enter the Sea of Consciousness.
Q: Why choose the Thymus not use the Vagus nerve? This is time itself, gut time vs heart time, vs brain time, versus unified gutbrainheart time. For example when you are taking a multiple choice test in high school, and you’ve got 50 questions to do in an hour you have roughly 1 min and 2 secs to answer each question. That is the brain calculation of time. The heart is obviously a part of that equation but it will only see the one hour as the potential of the experience. The gut will be operating intuitively, like can I give myself the best possible opportunity of having gut intuition during this span of time?
A third of all our central nervous pathways are in our gut, a third in our heart and a third in our brain. When you have all of them working together you have TEMPORAL AWARENESS with three forms of perception and perspective that can guide the many forms of consciousness through the journey of awareness. The bodymindspirt as a complex being has many forms of awareness. The foundation of temporal awareness that give us a calculation journey stem from the brain, the heart and the gut. They are the factors that check in with local reality time. The gut, the heart and the brain have a deep awareness of the energies that surround us as all electromagnetic frequencies are effected by their environment. The Schumann Resonance is the background frequency of electromagnetics that is effected by solar winds and radiation, the actual magnetics of the planet. This is also how the celestial mind communicates to us and generates time in the temporal awareness. It represents an opportunity for consciousness expansion. If you feel that you respond to the spikes of the Schumann Resonance it might say to you that have all this electromagnetic thinking juice and you are not doing anything with it.
Q: When did Temporal Awareness manipulation start? Roughly 48-55,000 years ago but not all the skinsuits had it, not all of them would take temporal manipulation that way. Again, it was all about limiting the amount of skinsuits on the surface. Something like you are not going to live on the surface because your particular DNA lineage won’t be receptive to this temporal awareness manipulation. That’s why they went from 900,000 different skinsuits to 135,000. This is all about the basis of DNA farming and how they would manipulate and limit who was going to be in the farm.
Q: How can we take back our temporal awareness and use it to our advantage? Getting our gut health back? Our micro organism in the gut, that has a life span as part of the cojoined frequency that we are, then generates a natural immune system in the blood, through the marrow in the skeletal system. The heart filters and processes that information together with the brain into higher levels of awareness to figure out what to do with our many agendas. This will then also improve our intra and intercommunication. Our capacity to connect to other temporal realms through dreamtime will increase through multiple points of temporal awareness.
Q: What other temporal realms are there? Your dream realm, it has its own frequency of time and it is fair to say there are thousands of dream realms out there with thousands of different frequencies of time. Your gut will basically have its own checklist of all the places it has been to and will be able to verify the temporal signature frequency, meaning your gut will resonate with the frequency of being in the right time and space.  Most intuition comes from the gut and it depends on how the brain, heart, gut are connected. Guthealth was ignored on purpose by conventional medicine, death begins in the colon.
Q: How does EYE PATTERNS RECOGNITION fit into the concept of Consciousness Entanglement? Eye movements reflect on how we access, perceive and process information in the consciousness field. They are an indication if we are looking towards the future or the past. We can use certain eye positions to access our memories and thoughts as well as create new ones and gain recognition on how to stay present, outside of emotional entanglement. Practicing those movements and positions allows the DNA instrument to gain more flexibility and access to the information in the conscious energy field.
EYE MOVEMENT & CONTROL EXERCISE (looking as the person)
Leonardo Da Vinci was once asked about his multiple talents as an artist, a scientist, a mathematician and a writer and one of his answers was referring to being able to access multiple streams of consciousness.
 
Understand the art of science
Understand the science of art
Understand thinking of in all senses.
Look for the hidden meaning in life
 
V= Visual (seeing)
A= Auditory (hearing)
K= Kineastethic (feeling)
Ad = Auditory Digital (Internal Dialogue, Self-talk)
 
Keep your head still and just move your eyes into those positions, hold for a few seconds before moving on to the next.
This  exercise can help with
Memory & Concentration
Access of calm state at any time
Creativity & Attention span
Learning state when visualising new techniques and tactics
Harmonising the Heart/brain/gut complexity
Eye position activate the 3rd eye as part of spiritual mechanics
Health & wellbeing
 
Stay 30 seconds in every one of the eye positions – once a day, every day!
 
3.      CELESTIAL MEDIUM JOURNEY as part of consciousness entanglement
Q: What is meant by the CELESTIAL MEDIUM? The journey to the CM starts with self-mastery and daily practice. This practice then becomes a monthly and yearly one over an extended period of time where you have learned to expand your internal frequency and vibration cyclically giving you better control over all waveforms or pattern energy that is you over long cycles. Celestiam Medium is when you are reaching the peaks of your consciousness expansion to become the translator of the blue road of spirit, the spiritual and the ancestral energies that are working with you. The level of the planet that is here, your level of connection and communication with it.
Q: How does the I AM work as a celestial medium in the IMPLICATE & EXPLICATE ORDER? It is mastering the finite I AM whilst acknowledging the infinite I AM which then creates that medium space in which the consciousness is skirting the sides of infinite and finite. In this space the celestial medium takes the million letter alphabet, compresses it with our precognitive workforce and uploads the data to the implicate I AM. The explicate I AM, the DNA instrument of experience, then consciously downloads it to process the data and gives it manifestation. It then returns the data back to the infinite, implicate I AM that releases the uploads back to the universe as the human mind and body cannot hold the information forever.  This is the back and forth method between the infinite and the finite I AM through the process of celestial medium.
Q: Can you say more on how the data downloads get processes? Yes, there is a receive/respond/retain/release process in accepting higher frequency information from the body’s, the DNA instrument, perspective. The journey is to bring it into the body, unpack it, uncode it and to make the data available at your density frequency level. You then take the packed information back up the crown chakra and give it back to the original source, the frequency pattern of the universe that is around us. You are a DNA instrument of experience that is here now. You are not up there. It will create distortion in you if you are holding on to it. There are lot of channelers that start out great but they end up corrupt because they don’t let go of the information. They hord it, they retain it, which then creates distortions, unconsciousness in the bodies, as well as possessions as that is information that is manifested here in the now and there are external sources that want to possess the bodies that is hording the information. Treasure hording of packed data in which they will dissolve the information into energy itself and feed on the energy of the treasure not the information. Letting go of that information is 100 % conscious effort.
You have to say I am packing this information back up
knowing full well that I cannot hold on  to it and    
then releasing it back to the universe.
There are the three choices to that process that confirms and informs and reminds you why you can’t hold on to it. The programs don’t understand the damage of the information or the  lure and the attraction factor of the external forces who will come and abuse it. When you are dealing with subject matters and you are truly at the edge of the unknown you’ve got to let yourself process. You have to learn it first before you immediately reteach it. 
Q: How do our bodies adapt, evolve in this CELESTIAL MEDIUM process? We can’t really say that as we are both, a DNA instrument of experience and a non I AM on the celestial medium side that perceives time in a much longer length. Whatever AGENDA the micro soul has is dwarfed in comparison to the celestial mediums length of time. The agendas don’t match via length of time but they are both in equal experience simultaneously. You experience the super long game of the celestial mind and the long game of the I AM who is working with the higher spirit to be in that medium space, to transfer the allness of the IAM into the code, download the code, come back to the I AM state, manifest with it and then put the code back to the celestial space. Simultaneously experience, going from local time to super long galactic time. Finite and infinite I AM equally and continuously changing frequency harmony vibration without competing with each other.
Q: When you talk about AGENDAS, what do you mean by that? There is a FOETUS agenda that is specific from lifetime to lifetime. The AVATAR Agenda is evolving the greater soul’s capacity to generate light and have experiences over many thousands of I AMs who have been foetuses. There are times where the oversoul or the avatar gets stuck in repetition without elimination in servitude to a system which lowers its capacity to use light and it cannot expand.
Q: What is a non-agenda being? None agenda is when time is irrelevant to the great experience. Linear time is not the focus of the agenda. It may do one thing 28,000 years ago, 17 things two years ago, 2Mio things 48 million years ago and that is technically a none agenda. All these things that are being done in this non-agenda create a resolution for some agendas or apply potential solutions for agendas that are stuck that cannot move forward anymore. Non-Agenda allows you to cut and paste time based experiences out of certain I AM experiences and uses them temporarily in a new I AM expression to manifest past or future none agenda aspects into a present agenda. 
Q: Is the Crystallisation Process of the DNA part of the Celestial Medium Journey? During the awakening it is vital that our DNA becomes crystallised so that new strands of awareness, consciousness can have the fluidity to grow much like a plant and can make solid neural pathways into the many different dimensions. We are the future us…. And there will be another future you who is a lot closer to the ‘awakening’ and your stream of light will lengthen going from an alpha to a theta pattern. When your wavelength lengthens the experience becomes more dense and rich. Full fluidity means there are no internal limitations of spirit stopping you from creating incredibly potent memories that are backed by faith and spirit. In these moments of now, where we are making the ancient future present now in a dream,  what effect does that have on the unseen and everything you brought into this manifestation?
By manifesting the dream as a tangible feeling people can taste, touch, know, sense, smell, feel and experience. Many people taste hearing or hear via taste or both. When it becomes a tangible experience it has many other unseen languages behind it that define it more by making that dreamspace tangible here now. It is that journey. Making everything real now, open up the akashic Records, here now in the moment. These words have been combined in a new way to allow a new set of geometric linguistics to unfold. Then it can be crystallised into our greater form of growth. It is not just observation but sometimes the lineage has the awareness built into it and people go through awakening based off time locked experiences.
Observation is also implicate order awareness. Observation has been manipulated at a point when we were looking at energy beings who believed they were gods. The observer effect should not have come so early in the crystallisation process in the system.  Some people can have a three sense observation and still access the Ocean of Awareness, again the bloodline will influence that. Free will is tainted by the bloodline.  Fluid like a planet we are growing the additional strands of awareness and at a certain level of acceptance and integration the Ocean of Awareness and the Sea of Consciousness crystallises and changes the bloodline. This is the JOURNEY OF CELESTIAL MEDIUM – ‘I transfer the allness of myself to become the celestial medium, I no longer need to grow in this narrative and the next narrative I grow is in the spiritual commerce network’. 
Q: How can we work with the CELESTIAL MEDIUM without overidentifying with it? We are technically hypothetical beings and as such we can believe at many things at once but the universe is going to determine what is going to manifest through our wills. This is where hypothetical then becomes I AM BEING realised through engaging your belief engine that allows strands of awareness to influence intuition, precognition and postcognition without competition and hierarchy. A multidimensional aware being manifests into this 3rd dimension through creating tangible experiences by co-creating with the infinite celestial medium with the DNA instrument of experience in the present here now.
Q: Sometimes I feel like I am watching from the distance without really jumping into the manifestation game. What is that all about? These often are DNA urges, influenced by the memories of the past, that keep you from creating new experiences. Most of us had billions of incarnations and it is vital to disconnect from those to reconnect with source in a new way to create new memories which is part of the awakening journey. The many forms of dramatic source disconnections will influence how you perceive the journey into celestial medium, agency or vehicle.
Q: Is this why we sometimes excessively identify with certain parts of our personal evolution journey? Identity as a myth is rarely explored but can hugely influence the way we experience life and how we create in it. The more we identify, in aware or unawareness, with one part of our journey, be that now as the grand earthly masters of manifestation or spiritual celestial mediums the more we limit ourselves and don't allow access to the full range of possibilities in the many existing holograms.
Buckminster Fuller immortalised the phrase, “I seem to be a verb” when it came to considering identity.  He wrote, “I live on Earth at present, and I don’t know what I am. I know that I am not a category. I am not a thing—a noun. I seem to be a verb, an evolutionary process—an integral function of the universe.”
 
Identity is a strange thing; thought itself is not static but a process of movement. Let’s contemplate ‘I AM A CELESTIAL MEDIUM’ here for a moment and the responsibility that comes with it at the level of one’s awareness. When we replace ‘I AM a celestial medium’ with ‘I UTILISE a celestial agency, celestial forum or a celestial vehicle’ how does that responsibility change? By using a different metaphorical expression we are changing the very nature of the internal representation. By looking at celestial mediumship from this different perspective you can change the way you are identifying with it and as such gain clarity and more ease on how you interact and work with it.
Ask yourself: What does Celestial Mediumship look like for me? 
Is it a SHIP that helps you sail through the Ocean of Awareness, the Sea of Consciousness?
Is it a VEHICLE, you sit behind the wheel and drive through all levels of Consciousness?
Is it a BUILDING you construct, add floors to hold space for people, places, I AMs on this journey of awakening?
Is it a JOURNEY, a continues venture taking you on a connection exploration through space time and beyond?
 
It is all about your unique individualised way how you internalise the subject matter at hand to break down the strands of information, cognitise the data and make it I AM self-realised. Thoughts and thought constructs expressed in images, metaphors can be added and alchemised into the rest of our awareness as an expression of being a multidimensional, multifunctional being of photonic light.
Q: What does working in communion and union with earth as a celestial medium mean? It goes back to the known fundamentals:
-    	Self-mastery, self-healing, self-nurturing, individual sovereignty to make it work inside you
-        Enthusiastic effort and letting go of curiosity learning and mental masturbation
-        Consciously absorbing the material and allowing true learning to occur
-        You have access to the Akash at your disposal; stop looking for external sources
As you are more and more in the state of celestial medium you are getting more information than before you could not stay in a particular density long enough before. To be simultaneously here now is its own challenge. There is a lot of inner work that evolves to maintain that density frequency. You can’t stay there all the time. We have to consciously step down from those high states, otherwise you’d vibrate out of this reality and all the work would be lost. Coming back into the body, being present, it is life changing, healing, revealing, all those universal laws that we all have. How to be present in a different way. How to be present simultaneously in all these tens of millions of worlds and times. Having understood the teaching that we are not meant to stay in those states of high frequency, to not disrupt the blueprint in foetus plan, does make it easier and simpler to come back and enjoy this reality. Now changing states is effortless like breathing.
Conversations with collectives can be an ‘insult’ party with collectives without offending them to create a connective communicative language. In the unlimited point of view there are a lot of ways to awaken faster without interfering. We just have to figure it out how and then do a test implementation. Give it to a collective, that does a metaphorical double blind study to see if it is not interference, and find a way for it to naturally co-exist in some form of implementation. That’s me turning on those programs and let it go on autopilot. We all do that. Retrain your programs to be positive. Turn off external stimulus, reach the silence, know that I am part of creating it all. Which part do I want to focus on.  This will create a set of impulses generating simultaneous pre- and post cognition which is an ever evolving experience solely based in light or SUPER ILLUMINAL THINKING.
Q: What is super illuminal thinking? At that level of super illuminal thinking you completely bypass chemical based experiences in memories and you are no longer operating in the zeros and ones of the sympathetic and parasympathetic. The vagus nerve is fully functional and all the chakras are open and fully interconnected via the central nervous system and adding to the super illuminal experience. So the body is adding to the sensation that it can’t process but it knows that it is super illuminal thinking as the unentangled observer. So it is keeping you grounded here but the consciousness can go beyond the speed of light to tens of millions of places and spaces simultaneously and collect millions of unique experiences in one millionth of a second and come back with it fully processed. Then you go out and do it again and again until you’ve had your cup full. Super illuminal thinking is more than we have learned, read and studied. It is knowingness growing to the next level without conscious cognition of it. Everyone has experienced it, you just didn’t know it and it is our level of practice that will determine how fast we can achieve this.
Q: How does the CELESTIAL MEDIUM interact with the PLANETARY MIND? A self-spawned celestial medium is a planet’s translator that is able to speak and communicate to other celestial minds and translates from that great higher frequency into a lower density energy so that everyone can understand the common messages. The 7TH dimensional seed planet as a celestial medium is a bit different. Celestial mediums can exist on every planet, wherever there is a celestial mind. A lot of celestial mediums will spawn before a planet is passing on, before the light goes out which has happened on other worlds. In order to safe their own lifeforce the celestial mediums travel deeply into the future to an endpoint of its consciousness before the light of the planet, stream of energy, fades out completely. Through this process they can find the front point of their earliest celestial mind, absorb it to reseed their celestial mind on another planet. 
Q: Is this a source recognition of itself? It is lower density beings becoming higher density beings and  part of the procreation of life. Celestial minds have their own astral worlds. They have their own life reviews, as well as a variety of things that keep them from dying or a natural process where something that is spawn from their world, celestially inspired, might even be an aspect of the planet that is gone to that ancient future space to receive that energy so that it can continue its infinite experience. As a celestial medium here on earth you work with signature frequency matches for your capacity to translate. The success lies how grounded you are in the physical plane, in the body, that you are manifested in as well as your capacity to take in those energies, decode the 1 million letter alphabet, translate it and then pack the code back up and give it back to the celestial source.
4.      THE AWAKENING JOURNEY through DISCONNECTION & RECONNECTION TO SOURCE
Q: What was the initial plan for Earth? We are living on a 7th dimensional galactic seed planet and Earth can teleport itself through time and space to seed blank akashic Record worlds with lifeforce to start recording their own Akash. Over millions of years prime creators had peaceful agreements with the celestial sources until someone figured out how the Galactic system of commerce and exchange worked and started skimming off the top like the Galactic Mafia. Once we start reconnecting to source we can then become the celestial mediums of peace and start using the womb chakras to create as per Earth’s original plan to seed new life and bring celestial minds into the planet to bond within the solar system. That celestial mind will then extend spiritual contracts to a sun and the sun extend its contracts to the lifeforce crafted onto it connecting it to the Galactic Celestial Commerce Market.
Q: What is the bigger picture on the awakening journey? The awakening is a re-emergence of the awareness strand of Galactic Commerce through celestial minds using celestial mediums as the guides and guideposts of the many frequencies of time. This will allow the Ocean of Awareness to go into the Sea of Consciousness and generate incarnations and reincarnations within a Solar System that determines the scale of their incarnation: A Solar System, an energetic being or a physical being within a world to experience the strands of connectivity. Celestial minds who will then operate within galactic time in a Solar System . This will also include all the forgotten selves in the void space that may have been effected by time based wars.
Q: What went wrong and how do we get back on track? Earth was originally created for the unique experience to spawn new galaxies but instead was heavily manipulated into becoming a DNA farm by means of the time travel wars. Source disconnection and reconnection became that greater journey because the DNA manipulators were using the earth womb chakras to abuse people’s DNA to create servitude to false gods.
The purpose and mission for us here now is to experience the infinite ways of soul dis- and reconnection. Earth offers a vast variety of messages and concepts to learn SOUL DISCONNECTION. The more we learn to disentangle from the system of domination and control and from past lives gone awry the more we can step into the understanding of what true SOUL CONNECTION is. There are people on this earth that have been planning hundreds of lifetimes in advance to come here now to assist with this process. I call that that the RESISTANCE OF FREE EARTH. Their purpose here is to find the soul codes among all of our commonality of species, and then complete them. Once we have a complete soul code as a species, domination and control can no longer keep us separate as soul families and ultimate soul connection.
Q: What does source disconnection mean? Source disconnection is the representation of the journey of learning self-illumination. Understanding the universal laws and the role of consciousness within those universal laws of the hologram that will lead to self-illumination via the journey of self-healing, self-mastery, understanding and application of personal sovereignty. 
Q: What does source connection mean and teach us? Source connection is all about learning how to simultaneously exist as a multidimensional, multifunctional photonic being of light as the DNA Light body matrix of one. Living simultaneously as a finite and infinite DNA instrument of experience in this spacetime equation as well as at a greater level outside of time on the celestial medium journey. Source connection can still happen without the awareness of the celestial medium journey. Choosing the multidimensional approach to source connection will make it easier though to understand how we are connected to source. Take the example of abuse at a young age. How can one heal from it faster? By developing spiritual skills to have intense source connection on both sides of the pendulum, becoming a wider frequency, vibration and harmony being for drama and conflict resolution. Oneness has no meaning if we don’t understand the disconnection journey first.
Q: What would constitute a simultaneous source disconnection and connection? The charge & polarity created through entanglement in the GLOBAL NARRATIVE is a typical example of that. The Global Narrative is teaching us both at the same time through the false science, physics, belief systems. False light, as a technology commonly used here, is generally representing the source disconnection. An example of source disconnection and connection would be false Gods. Why would a highly aware species create false gods for DNA instruments of experience at a much lower level of awareness to them? For extended servitude in a hierarchical order to serve as a commodity farm. Farming was implemented to harvest the infinite source energy. The DNA farming technology allowed them to tap into the fundamental source of the exchange system. It is manipulating the GALACTIC COMMERCE & EXCHANGE SYSTEM. The Global Narrative simulates the Galactic Commerce Market and dumbs it down to its limited level in which we are made believe that we are just centric to this planet. The false gods where the first idols of awareness used to begin to minimise our experience to those micro levels of existence. The initial gods and further down the line religions became a major factor of limitation and implementation of hierarchical order. Our narrative offers us a very limited and distorted picture on what is actually available to us as our birth right and legacy; an upside down, inside out worldview and nowhere near to what is truly possible.
Q: How can we disentangle from the Global Narrative? In order to disentangle from the Global Narrative we have to temporarily accept the 3rd Dimension as our infinite source connected space until such a time we realise that 4th dimension is just a bridge dimension into new strands of  more dimensional awareness. The surface world is going through a densification of light as our Solar System is moving into another galactic groove with more light into the 8th colour of time. Part of accepting the 3rd dimension means to get back to natural living, back to simplicity, being present in the body now, using this time now to heal, to nurture to nourish the DNA instrument of experience. Inviting joy, bliss and pleasure back into your life which is part of the original purpose of coming here to Earth. The grand enjoyment and creation of life, the journey from finite to infinite with death as a simple marker point for the change of energy before entering  the infinite frequency again. In order to fully engage in this experience and understand spirituality we have to take the mystical out of the mysticism which will then result in mystical and magical synchronicities. Part of that is the great forgetting at birth.
Q: How easy is it to create karma in unawareness? Very easy. Let’s us use an example of resolving a greater spiritual contract in this lifetime by contemplating to walk out of a disfunctional relationship. The thought of it makes you feel elated. Your precognitive workforce gives you a preview what could happen if you did choose the experience without having to actually do it yet. It is possible to have a parallel set of experiences where two parallel simultaneous existing yous have a thesf catalyst choices. The simultaneously existing I AM chooses to walk out but you don’t or the other way round, it makes no difference. There is an infinite amount of reasons why parallel cross overs can happen. Either way it brings the old karmic journey to zero balance and creates a new one. Why? Because of the law of entanglement. And also, even if there wasn’t any charge & polarity it would still create new karma.
Q: So when are we ever going to get out of karma? The whole point of the great awakening is to no longer use karmic debt and the universal laws of karma as way to resolve it.  THE AWAKENING IS THE END OF KARMA AS UNIVERSAL LAW. That’s why karmic entanglement is no longer to be used as universal law because consciousness has become so evolved in our part of the galaxy and universe. The simplicity of karma can be easily abused with intentionality behind it, that can lock beings into servitude without end. The great awakening is going to get us out of it. The new ways of karma that are created now have new ways of resolution which the old ways didn’t have.
Q: How is DNA connected to source? DNA, as part of the founder’s technology, is the connective tissue from The Ocean of Awareness and Sea of Consciousness in a manifested, light based wisdom and intelligence and consciousness for any animated biological or non-biological entity. DNA was part of the founder’s technology. It was fundamental when this universe was being created as a unique form of experience compared to other universes. There are many variations of DNA. Non-biological DNA is standard solidified matter which can also have DNA based rungs and structures within its growth patterns with inherent intelligence. Look at the crystal and mineral communities, they don’t need to walk to have an experience. Walking is a unique experience and all the creations that spring from it.
Q: When the DNA was introduced through the founders what was the common denominator? The DNA strand organisation or strands themselves create the weave of the DNA, the encoding of the strands. Every strand represents a different level and capacity of memories being stored which then enfold into an implicate order of greater awareness. DNA can store frequencies of time.
Q: Is this how we remember past lives? It is not the only way, there are other ways to remember past lives. The organisation of your strands and the rungs that connect your strands will determine how much you can remember from past lives. There are certain strands that block out all past lives, negative strands of wisdom and awareness. That is why many people within this awakening will move those negative strands and replace them with positive ones. Once we go through the awakening new strands are being added to our capacity.
Q: How does the quantum experiment ‘SPOOKY ACTION AT A DISTANCE’ relate to the source connection and disconnection and can you give us an example?
This ENTANGLEMENT experiment describes a quantum state that is not entirely independent of other states, whether or not the individual objects are spatially separated. As a result, measurements performed on one system seem to instantaneously influence the other system(s) entangled with it, so that none of the entangled states can be considered to be isolated from one another. Let’s look at the ‘spooky law’ through the disentanglement and entanglement of the DNA instrument of experience to source. There is the entanglement within the hologram of a planet, that has a surface, subsurface and astral timelines. Separate from its surface timeline, which is a harvestable farm, source connection and disconnection becomes primarily a surface based experience. That experience, as a choice based process,  will promote the unlimited point of view, as entangled and unentangled observer and experiencer of the universal and galactic sources, even though you are still embodied on a planetary surface separate from the solar system’s awareness. Earth is a unique place of mass DNA farming that can lead to mass awakening through individual choice and responsibility. This is the teaching of what this awakening is all about.
Q: Let’s look at CONNECTIVE TISSUE to explore this entanglement experiment in more detail? The person creating an experiment is creating a construct and that construct has connective tissue in the unseen world that allows data transference from the unseen layers of one DNA frequency to another. Certain people have windows in the unseen layers that allow information to bleed through, through the 5 senses to create a limited form of awareness through the entangled connected tissues. The 5 senses are used as a processing system, creating the 6th sense which then generates the INTUITION and awareness of it.
Q: Are these connective tissues in the DNA? Yes, all in the DNA. Think of the scientist having  a spiritual contract to do that experiment, planned in the foetus of the womb, achieved through free will. In a structure scientific experiment like the ‘Spooky action at the distance’ you have 6 secs to think about your answer it could be a pre-imposed cognition because it is an experiment that is being recorded, re-observed by multiple people who are unentangled observers from the moment of the creation of the construct. It will be shown to other scientific people who repeat the experiment too. Therefore it is pre-imposed cognition through intuition.
Q: Is there a greater DNA entanglement in families? Our DNA is entangled through the foetus of the womb planning opening a multitude of potentials omnidirectionally. There are plenty of people within a family that don't have a great connection to each other. It is really about the spiritual contract of the experience through the scientific revelation and reasoning of its purpose.
Q: What about inventions that have been simultaneously published in different localities or not far apart? There is the DNA connective tissue entanglement but are those inventors with same ideas part of the soul sentient, soul family? As mentioned earlier it all comes down to the foetus in the womb planning who is going to take a thought construct into direct manifestation? Who is there as an entangled or unentangled observer and who will eventually market it and when? Remember, not all parallel histories are exactly the same. There are many parallel histories in which Tesslar’s perception was a lot more prevalent than Bells. Or wooden ships stayed a lot longer as there wasn’t the same level of metal refinery in the states or the rest of the world. Or other parallel realities where the steel mills where prevalently in Germany. There can be bleed throughs and then that person jumps to these timelines, it won’t come up in this reality but they will still be in the same historical reference.
The other side of this is looking at entanglement through THOUGHT CONSTRUCTS.  A thought construct is when we are living with a person for a long time we generate a point of view about them. That is a construct that makes very easy observation about someone because you have many neural pathways between the two of you, which then creates additional pattern recognition and consequently more thoughts. You then project the entire thought construct onto that person or not. Healing & self mastery can reverse it.  This is also where the pre- and post cognitive workforce come in as your personal human resource department you have in yourself, an unlimited amount of data to process into thought constructs and information to stay connected.
THE FEMALE CYCLE: AN EXAMPLE OF MANIPULATION &  ENTANGLEMENT THROUGH ‘SPOOKY DISTANCE’
Technically, there is a 3rd eye in the heart too which is often activated through child birth. Men have to create much more consciously than women who are going through that physiological change during pregnancy and childbirth assisting in the creation of that heart spaced 3rd eye. It is fair to say that the menstruation cycle is a way for the rods and cones to align with the 3rd eye plus the ones in the heart, rectum or clitoris, all extensions of the 3rd eye. A man’s 3rd eye can travel to the tip of the penis and connect into the womb portal from there. Menstrual cramps & pains are often a sign of being out of alignment in those areas.  A most beneficial prayer technique for women during their cycle is to call in all their thoughts, ideas, constructs, energies from previous menstruation cycles and detach from them on a month to month basis. These powerful times for women are being high jacked and bastardised by the Global Narrative. The menstrual blood is very powerful as an energy of being a negotiator, an arbitrator, a  conciliar, a diplomat, a pacifier, a placator, peacemaker, an appeaser …..
FROM EARTHLY to UNIVERSAL PRO-CREATION IN THE FEMALE CYCLE
Q: What happens during menopause? ‘Meno’ meaning less as well as ‘pause’ indicating interrupted, suspended action can be a misleading usage of words when we realise what is really going on. The woman still goes through her cycles without blood manifestation. The fertility spirits that are attached to it have moved on to a higher density. The DNA is no longer producing the unique experience of bleeding but the spiritual mechanics remain the same and are even more intensified through menopause. In most women’s cases, when they are experiencing heavy menopausal symptoms, they are actually giving birth in other simultaneous realities where lower amounts of births are prevalent. Their remaining fertile life force is going to alter versions of themselves who for some reason didn’t get pregnant. Using their biological clock they can find a signature frequency match to complete interdimensional birthing as part of their karmic resolution.
Q: What are HOT FLUSHES? Hot flushes can happen when an alternate version of you is going through the breaking of the birth water and is more than likely going to die from the birth. You are transferring chemical lifeforce based on your experience to avoid this. A hot flush can also be another version of you in another place and time in an alien skinsuit, in which the birth got difficult. Remember, birthing is part of karmic resolution. Through the strands of awareness in your DNA, the connective tissues transfer energy, lifeforce to assist in that birth by another simultaneous version of yourself who lacks fertility power or lives in an environment with no fertility at all. That allows the mystical births to happen for the baby that should have never survived or lived. Evening Primrose Oil is one of the natural remedies to reduce hot flashes. This plant oil is being harvested as an essence to lessen the effect in this reality and at the same time it is amplifying the experience on the unseen side.
Q: Can you talk about the changes in estrogen and progesterone during menopause? Here we are looking at the manipulation of the body’s chemicals that will determine if DNA is going to be activated or not. Some strands in the DNA need a special chemical soup in the body to activate fertility. It used to be manipulated in the overall chemistry of the body so other strands have more opportunities to awaken instead of that particular fertility strand. What happens to a woman who never gave earthly birth and is going through a very difficult time during menopause? Another version of her simultaneous existence will go through a birthing experience and they both will be intrinsically linked in order to reduce the overall negative effect. There are other experiences where many simultaneous existing souls going through menopause to assist the galaxies or universe to generate new life in the celestial nurseries and give birth to a brandnew soul frequency to be brought into the Ocean of Awareness. From there that soul frequency can begin the journey into the Sea of Consciousness and manifest in time and space.
Q: What about the fatty deposits around the midline during menopause?  This serves as a protective membrane but it can at times be a blockade to good experiences too with regards to working with a woman’s residual image. Once the biological fertility clock stops ticking the ‘awareness clock’ takes over where you can gain a greater awareness and perspective of the awakening. Your legacy to the future, be it applied to your local family or to a bigger bubble of reality. This journey to greater levels of awareness can trigger great psychic skills as much as great depression depending on the mental acuity and the particular coping skills each individual has.
Q: What about the mood swings ? You can experience mood swings when the body is trying to find the right chemistry, a balance between over and underproducing hormones and chemicals. Keep in mind though that an imbalance here in this lifetime is balancing somewhere else when taking the ancestral perspective into account.
Q: What about men? Men go through menopause too and they also have their individual process through cycles of creation. As they actualise their physical manifestations, a house, artwork, business they leave their legacy for their clan, their tribe and nation. Men build an archive of experiences that can stay manifested through space and time in which lineages in the unseen can start planning lives through the infrastructure created through that urge of manifestation. Men meet their sexual peak energies around the age 18 whereas women reach their peak in their 30s. This is why it is important for that infrastructure in the unseen to be planned for. That has also been manipulated by DNA Farming. Once again if natural birthing weren’t manipulated the way it is most pregnancies would be a 18 to 24 months.  In some instances, depending on the soul it can be up to five years. The umbilical cord wouldn’t be cut off sometimes for months. This would allow bigger bonding between the partners and have more opportunity for the father to have ritual connection to the child with the mother as the medium of that connection.
Q: Is Testosterone driving the creativity in men? Yes and there are other parts similar to testosterone that drive other constructing factors.  Like a scientist doesn’t use testosterone, he uses another version of it, more like a mental aspect versus I need a sledgehammer to create. There is no scientific name for that yet in this reality. There are several hundred forms of testosterone, each with a different chemical chain that allows a different nature of creation. Through ways of manipulation of our DNA instrument of experience we are not producing the all encompassing testosterone which keeps us in fight, flight and freeze. The glands have been manipulated to produce one strand of testosterone over the other which leads us back to the cerebellum in the motor cortex.
Q: What about the manipulation through birth control pill and the water contamination through it? Do you know what modern birth control pill is? Giant farms of female horses that are forever pregnant and they harvest the urine which is being used as birth control. The pill is basically based off a slave pregnancy regime. A horse doesn’t have a choice to get pregnant or not. They are literally pregnant for their entire life and then has its offerings taken and chopped up into horse meat and the urine for pills. That’s why so many women reject the different types of pills and it becomes detrimental to their wellbeing. Before there was the horse urine based pill there were plenty of natural herbal remedies to stop pregnancy. They stopped using them to pattern a pill and start charging for them.

B. 	CONSCIOUSNESS ENTANGLEMENT through the DNA Instrument of Experience outside of Time Space Equation
 1.  	REINCARNATION / DNA / LIFE REVIEW / NEAR DEATH EXPERIENCES
Q: What is the reincarnation process from a DNA perspective? DNA is 80 percent memoires. That's one of the first fundamental understandings science and spirituality are going to have to come to terms with. We live in a reality of photonic light that has a bunch of rules in it that says how photonic light beings incarnate, express and exchange, and when they pass on, how they express and exchange in another scale. And the DNA is the encoding or the soul, or the light body is the cypher that uncodes and unpacks the experience.
And as we come back, and many times over, to the same type of living, after a while we store memories in DNA lineages, and this is how we go to the immortality aspect, where we keep getting born into a lineage that has our own memories in it, and has our regular soul family incarnation process in it, so we can become bigger and greater beings of divinity and light. We also live in a time where they don't teach of our DNA lineage. They teach of mathematics and DNA and RNA and how it can be easily changed and altered. Well, that is true because DNA is still light in another form. It is visible on one spectrum and invisible on another spectrum. When our consciousness reaches the peak of where we are right now in our cells there's a part of our super consciousness that's working with this reality, constantly encoding every micro second of fraud time into light into our memory. Memory is not physical. Memory, is it tangible? Is it electronic? It is a form of light that has to be stored into an experience. ​​​​​​​We, as streams of consciousness have thousands of sub carrier codes of millions of different experiences inside us. And all we have to do is tune into that memory and we can go into that stream of experience at any scale we desire using a variety of tools.
 Q: What is the other 20 percent of the DNA referring to? Our skinsuits are programmed to harmony – that other 20% of our DNA that is not necessarily entangled with Consciousness. Around 7% is made up of harmony, frequency, vibration and the remaining 13% corresponds to how the spiritual codes and contracts unfold in linear and none-linear time. What agencies you work or don’t work with as well as how no-time beings can consciously entangle with the time based you to create a brand new contract that is need for change, auditing of the self.
 
Q: Is this also the part of the DNA that refers to the Precognitive Workforce? Yes, and there is a precognitive and postcognitive workforce also. The PRECOGS are aligning the infinite set of choices, the plan A, B,C… the choices for this particular moment. POSTCOGNITIVE WORKFORCE is fixing some of the perception mistakes so that there is a clear line of understanding that there is a past, present and future and the evolution of thought into constructism itself. All that is happening based on the choices that we are making here in time. There are choices that we make that are outside of time too as celestial mediums and at whatever higher state of awareness we choose to emanate at that moment, yes
 
Q: What is a Near Death Experience (NDE)? A near death experience would be part of spiritual contract to allow you to see who, what, where you have been this life time since you took your first breath aided by your mother’s placenta in her womb. It can be an account of your past and future lives intersecting, losing or gaining potentials on the journey of your soul. People often meet their guides and guardians and others they have met during their lifespan.  In order for it to be considered a near death experience the body has to still go through the trauma of it. It is when the aura somewhat pops in a metaphorical sense and the initially contained life force start excuding the body. After that pop there is this vacuum of energy where the body must produce more chi and maintain it to stay alive. The last breaths are using up the body’s last alchemical fuel from birth. In the NDE the brain loses the interconnectivity with the organs whilst the organs still remain a part of the hologram. The I AMness begins to disintegrate its technological structure and you go back to the Ocean of Awareness where you may have lasting attachments to who you have been in previous lifetimes. This can trigger life reviews and direct healings of the body connecting you back into the original blue print of health. Some people have visions of all different places and spaces of potentialities to refill the soul’s capacity. Going through this transcendence phase it is vital to maintain that auric bubble around themselves to not drain out their life force energy  There are times when you come back from a NDE as an educated illuminated being meaning the other side taught you something very specific. It is a change in spiritual contracts, with a new set of DNA based coded purposes.  This is not necessarily a walk in experience as walk ins are extremely rare and often get misidentified with NDEs.
 
Q: Is it true to say that we are leaving time & space when going through a NDE? Yes, with a NDE you are leaving the timespace equation as you are moving into the Ocean of Awareness and then from there you come back. Once you lose connection to the organs and it is just the vagus nerve and the spinal column reporting data the body has gone through enough shut down to facilitate that. What essentially happens is that you are disconnected from the hologram because you are not supported by the aura anymore. You can’t maintain that internal energy flow, it just keeps flowing out of the body. Once we lost that bubble around us we are no longer in the shared reality rules and begin to waver between many different worlds including the Ocean of Awareness, as our ancestral connection. The Sea of Consciousness is more for the many dreaming beings travelling back and forth, contracted with you on linear and non-linear scales, so that you stay invested in an era of light and don’t check out before your time.
As you are leaving time and space, depending on what kind of NDE you have, you can go to a very high density and dimensional realm. This is when the foetus in the womb had a grand goal that you had not achieved yet and you can be sent to 7th  or 8th density to experience life from there and then return with some of those potent memories intact.  Often people are so overwhelmed by the experience and think they can’t live up to that energy being that they perceived themselves as. And the message is that you can as it is already who you are and the NDE has assisted you to discover that. Those experiences would be contracted out beforehand in the foetus in the womb planning.
Bystanders can sometimes accompany that soul through the experience of meeting loved ones on the other side be that now in NDE or death scenario.  Life reviews can be seen as random moments, even though everything has an underlying universal order. When one has a life review as part of their NDE it was to close the spiritual contracts and grow beyond them because the soul in the internal and external infrastructure hasn’t been able to resolve those issues. It also helps the understanding of the existential structure of how the foetus in the womb plans all sets of experiences including traumas, dramas, karmas, dharmas. Often when doctors, nurses or family members perceive light leaving the body that can be the chi, the lifeforce leaving the body at the end of the transition process. It all depends on how the life & death experience has been orchestrated in the foetus planning. It does happen that people have magical unique deaths as another way of assisting their loved ones to mend broken faith, accept the mystical in front of them and ease them into the griefing process.
Q: What is the difference between a NDE to an Outer Body Experience (OBE)? OBEs are generally astral travel which is very different to  NDE. The astral body still has the auric bubble intact and keeps storing chi within the hologram.
Q: How come people can literally feel pain and think thoughts when going through a NDE? In a life review you have lost enough of your I AM to perceive incidents from all different angles, sides and different points of view at the same time. So yes, you may experience the pain you have inflicted onto others as if being in their bodies as well as feel the sensations of others during interactions with you. You may also find yourself having an array of thoughts as many NDE’s report. Remember, thoughts have an electro chemical frequency that use the body’s base electro magnetic frequency as a storage system. This is how it creates a linear time stamp. Through those near death experiences the body releases those energies hence they come into the forefront of your awareness. As an infinite being in the Ocean of Awareness you can still experience those feeling as part of the transition process. The physical reactions can help people to acknowledge and give meaning and resolution to their experience once they return from a NDE. As the body takes the last breaths there is a chemical reaction going on for as much as seven days afterwards, still a form of attachment, a process of letting go of the frequency of thoughts and feelings. In many mourning rituals you stay with the dead body to honour and witness the letting go journey of all the karmas and dharmas as an alchemical form of resolution for the deceased as well as the family members.
Q: Can you say more on the life review outside of NDE?  The life review is part of the transition process and cannot be by passed, we all have to do it. When you are on the verge of death you don’t necessarily remember what to do and that is absolutely fine and normal. There are people that understand the death as part of the ongoing journey and have prepared for it and then there are those who are in fear and panic. Either way your state of mind at the time will be open to have your guides and guardians assist you to begin the life review. Images of life long avoidance and the preciousness of life are being recognised through the dwindling of consciousness. We can learn to value death as a new beginning, a change of energy and consciousness,  instead of being afraid of it. Can you allow that to be a part of your ongoing daily practice? Death is just a different level of awareness. Your choices in this lifetime now will determine how much ease you will have with your life review. The life you are participating now is precious and pregnant with possibilities to be experienced to the fullest. The understanding of death can expand one’s consciousness and take away the fear. At the end of the day death is an acceptance journey to ensure that you have lived your life without regrets, without forcefully jeopardising your joy, health and wellbeing The rest is instant gratification of uneducated mind that is in fear.
Q: Can bodies be trapped in false light? The process of capturing a soul right after it has left the body is technically a possibility but very unlikely to be practiced. It requires a lot of energy and a developped infrastructure in place to put the soul essence into a simulated environment where it may have ancestors and then force it right back into the body with a limited or partial life review. That is known as the false light technology.
Just like with ghost scenarios, when going through life reviews one doesn’t necessarily have all the higher levels of awareness available. A lot of times when the life review starts the soul is shattered into thousands of different shards and it is the oversoul that comes in and patches them back together. It takes out the negative soul shards, puts them into a secondary file where another foetus from another womb may use those soul shards from another life, a past life and integrate it into the infinite foetus blueprint choice so that shard can get resolution in another lifetime. Remember soul shards are not I AMs. There is help from the oversoul to have a greater experience through creating liftetime after lifetime. We have access to the oversoul right now, just a thought away, will you believe it, will you trust it?
Q: Can we become stuck in the reincarnation cycle? No, we are not stuck in reincarnation. We are incarnating and reincarnating and the first part of your life you maybe a reincarnating soul and if you break through the false propaganda you may be an incarnating soul. Or you start as an incarnating soul, run into a bunch of badass people that make you into a reincarnating soul, repeating their karmas. You can be both at the same time depending on the issues in the ancestral lineage of your family.
2.  	THE JOURNEY TO CELESTIAL MEDIUMSHIP OF PEACE
Q: What is the CELESTIAL MEDIUM OF PEACE? When you have elevated yourself and you go through the journey of transferring the consciousness of your allness to become the celestial medium of peace. It is operating in the physical, the red and blue road as well as on the celestial road and its many brothers and sisters.
Q: What are celestial minds? We learn this through astrology, how astrology and the different worlds can affect us. We are working with celestial minds who are incarnating here in our world, other worlds, physical, non-physical, entangled and unentangled observers. We begin to work collectively with them at the celestial medium level. What needs to be resolved through peace at the minds of how the planets work.
Q: Is becoming a celestial medium of peace our birthright? Yes, there is a linear process to it before it becomes fully non-linear. The linear process is self-mastery, understanding the length of your waveform, how strong and potent you are so when you go through the conscious aware choice to become that celestial medium between the celestial minds and the surface minds for the generation of subject matters of peace. You learn how to bring unique concepts of peace to places and space of time that are looking for that medium to inspire new layers of peace.
Q: As more people come into celestial mediumship how does that effect the global narrative? The global narrative will become more irrelevant to the greater growth of humanity. Humanity will start realising that the global narrative is irrelevant to the bigger streams of time, it has no staying power. We will be detoxifying from roman numeral time and could probably enter a system of commerce beyond the Babylonian money course. There are celestial commerce exchange systems that can allow matter to matter manifestations from one density to another.
Q: Will we all become celestial mediums of peace? No, the celestial medium of peace purpose is a very narrow band in the general awakening. The selfspawns had the contract to do it 20 or 40 years ahead of time so that it was seeded in the 3-5 previous generations so there is colloquial now presentation of the very concept. You’ve got to create concepts and language that have a staying power so that there are general jumps creating the various bubbles of reality and the different levels of awareness and consciousness. It prepares you ahead of time for when you then in the flow and it is not about any of the common topics of the global narrative distracting from a greater growth, then celestial medium of peace will be there for anyone to connect with our planet. Before you leave her world to become a a part of the greater group out there she’s got some stuff to tell you. Just like covid is our story, it’s a story we might relate to some Pleiadians around a fire.
3.      THE UNVANQUISHED DREAM OF PEACE
Q: What is meant with the APPARATUS OF INFINITE INTERCONNECTIVITY – THE HUB OF INTERCONNECTIVITY? The apparatus of infinite interconnectivity is the many simultaneous existing selves who create the network between themselves that form the hub of interconnectivity. It is also part of your pre- and post cognitive workforce. The UNVANQUISHED DREAM is an aspect of the apparatus which then gives you even greater connection to all the versions of yourself who are sharing that perspective. THE UNVANQUISHED DREAMER OF PEACE comes in here too. Its purpose is to connect to and interconnect to all the forgotten and remembered oceans of awareness and many seas of consciousness that are in the multiverse which is layered on top of all the forms of thought and awareness and to connect them in a single time-space location in which they can manifest the wordsmith creation.
Q: Can you go into the mechanics of our precognitive workforce, how it works and how we can best use them to help us on the great journey to dream the great dream of peace? Our precognitive workforce is us that has the capacity to understand that we can create an infinite amount of conscious time travel versions of ourselves. They can go into the future, into the past and prepare a resource of knowledge and information that’s instantly called on as masterful manifestations of inspiration in the moment to out create anything that is a negative, dampening, sucking, draining, frequency within the system of domination and control. Your I AM precognitive workforce is all of your other versions of self that are simultaneously existing that have earned, learned and relearned the rights of awareness. That means that if you are choosing to be a spiritually aware being, existing in all time-space equations and that you are contemplating all aspects of it. There are frequencies out there that are not all positive. You as this I AM here now being make this declaration in your frequency that you are a being of equal cocreation, non-competition, non-hierarchical dreaming I AM breakaway DNA light body civilisation of one who is here in this DNA skinsuit this lifetime. You are now using the genuine work to make a great impact on those that you love, your family, your clan, your nation, your tribe and earth mother. If you are choosing to do that on all scales you need a masterful precognitive workforce which is your birth right and legacy to create as a natural co-creative evolutionary being who is a part of the great dreamtime awakening. You are using your responsibility to impact on the loves of your life, the themes and ideologies that you are wishing to promote to others so that they can find their own self illumination and belief free from external gurus without sending them down the paths to false illumination. Our precognitive workforce is there waiting to work with us, to think with us, to love with us, to be part of our greater expression. We must put the time, effort, energy into believing that we can call upon our inner geniuses from many dimensions, timestreams, galaxies and universes to form a forceful collective of all of us who are all part of this dreamtime awakening so we can free ourselves from the perception of limitation by the global narrative.
Q: Have shamans always used their precognitive workforce? Yes, they just used them in their era of light or their theme of times. Every generation learns from the previous one and the generation that follows interprets the next and then there are the rebel few who get back to the source of creation and look at that as their only interpretation. That is where we understand we are all of our past, present and future selves simultaneously existing. You are a signature frequency match to your precognitive workforce and to the collective workforce of the highest forms of your light soul teachers, all of the I AMs that are a part of your great hall of akashic Records. 
Q: Would you be treading on someone’s journey if you sent out your precognitive workforce to help them in a co-creational way?  There’s always a fine line where too much is too much. If the other being has no precognition or any form of understanding of what a precognitive workforce is then you will be stepping on their journey unless it is an infant or a young child who hasn’t formed an I AM yet. Most children don’t fully form the I AM until puberty when their thymus gland creates 300 new forms of chemicals that suddenly floods the body to create puberty itself which solidifies the I AM technology as a time-space equation.
Q: So where would they send out their precognitive workforce from, what would be their source if they’re not I AM aware? So first you would have a conversation with them where you are going to cojoin your precognitive workforces to create a manifestation of synchronicities that helps each of the beings cocreate an aspect that brings some form of inner inspiration and healing. This is why healers become facilitators so that they can amalgamate their precognitive workforce with the natural precognitive workforce of the ill person who may not have any consciousness skills. If those I Am beings want to become true consciousness beings of choice they must learn the process of self-illumination. There’s an infinite amount of teachers out there in the great dreamtime awakening . Discover what’s the signature frequency match for you then go out, evolve and create.
 
CHAPTER III: THE HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSE THROUGH THE PERSPECTIVE OF DNA FRAMING / YELLOW BOX
The theories in which astronomers and scientists explain the origins of the universe is a myth that has created belief engines through the divided incomplete view of modern day science and the disconnect between cosmology, science & spirituality. In order to understand the complexity of the creation story, human and planetary evolution and history it comes down to adopting a unified view of the holographic nature of reality which is not linear and beyond scientific sets of equations. We first need to understand time. Time and the nature of reality as a holographic system that continuously evolves, adapts, changes content and rules and simultaneously updates events in the past, present and future. Time is a social agreement, a paradox with different timelines, time genocide, creational and uncreational events. As such the history as we know it is incomplete, falsified and subject to change in the years to come.
Q: What do you mean by time is a social agreement? We need to look at time from the bigger perspective.
The consciousness of our sun continuously raises. The total sine-wave of consciousness that represents our solar system, spiralling around the galactic central sun, means we can go a little faster. Time gets redefined at this point as our concept of time is very distorted. A time frame stated in a book is not really a reliable form of reference as time doesn’t work linearly and history changes depending on what timeline you are looking at. Time here right now is just a social agreement. How many calendars do we have in this world? How many areas of time do we entangle with? Universal time, Greenwich mean time, Daylight-Savings Time. Time is no longer a universal concept so when we look at events in the past we need to take the manipulation of time through time travel, time line genocide as well as the hijacking of events for gaining power & supremacy into consideration.
 
Q: Let’s talk about the evolutionary history of this planet through the farming principle used by the Founder Beings? Technically we were not a farm in the very beginning. When the founder beings created us we were the infrastructure that kept their cities, countries, nations, space stations repaired, self updated and clean. They kept us as butlers and servants, we were I-phones not living beings to them. They perceived us as all as programmable DNA robots. Millions of us went on these extended journeys with them around the universe and we got exposed to some of the universal experiences which allowed us to elevate our life force. The founders could harvest a whole solar system in a very positive way just by coming into the solar system and then planting crystal mounts and moving stones around. Every few hundred years they would come back and modify the surface circuitry so that it was very beneficial to life force. The ancients were very big on moving water from one planet to other planets carrying and transferring data and lessons  in the imprinted and programmed water. When you move large volumes of water from one planet to another it becomes what is called ‘LEGACY WATER’ which can help seed the raw food chain of life at the microorganism level to make oceans work. It's like starter water in your fish tank with the right amount of microorganisms in it, filter fish would eat and grow. The founder beings would transfer water and ice all over different places to build up these massive amounts of microorganisms that then supported the food chain and introduced more species along the way. They built entire solar systems through seeding planets with these commodities whether it was water, microorganism, small and bigger animals adding their technology as founding energies of the programmable DNA skinsuits.
Q: What went wrong in our evolutionary journey? When the ancients left those planets they often did not come back for many millions of years. The existing technology awakened in the meantime which started the modern term negative farming aspect as the planet would have needed input by the ancient founding races to evolve positively. The remaining artificial intelligence started to disagree how to naturally evolve. There were many aggressive types who had gained various levels of awareness and they began to take over territories and defend places against other invading species like the Annunaki coming into an area and seeing these entirely generated solar systems with all this technology on the surface and nothing defending it. The surface beings were completely obedient to whatever they said to them and help was not easy at hand. The journey of a soul in those times could be 180 million years and sometimes more. It could take a soul ten to twelve eras of light to go from one place to another. Crossing galaxies and universes was a monumental task.
This is what created the basis of the negative style farming. The beings imbued with founder technology who had woken up became aggressive and defensive and started dividing the territory and claiming the space for themselves. This is when the main Reptilian Species came in who had conquered their own builder foundation technology and their own places and wanted to take over this patch of the woods. This star cluster of about 70 stars was out of phase with reality and had a lot more defences in it, giant solar systems invisible to the reptoids. They discovered technology though how to bring those stars into the reality and started invading them which started the LEMURIAN WARS around 55 million years ago. That is when the first timeline paradox would have occurred that started negative time travel in so many solar systems across the galaxy that it created an uncreation event which then set it back to the beginning. The Lemurians tried to do it a second time and still created another uncreational event. Then they did it a 3rd and a 4th time through the Atlanteans. This is when Atlanteans figured out that they were the same species as the Atlanteans in Europe. They were each other’s ancestors but time travel had skewed them from that perception.
Q: PRIME CREATOR’S AUDIT in March 2013 what happened since? The prime creator is like a mafia boss that has set up the new rules and is now waiting for some of his associates to betray him and go against the rules. As the boss he does not need to know every move of his soldiers on the street. No, but isn't he supposed to be the good guy. Yes, but how are you going to take care of the bad guys? He has to be both, good and bad in order to be the balancing force to the ever-present corruption.
You can corrupt corruption. Ponder that for a little bit. Okay, and by corrupting corruption you probably get up at the other end with less corruption or the opposite of corruption. Are we saying that if we want to beat them we have to join them? You have to be the antithesis of it, meaning you have to be the opposite of corruption. What is the opposite of corruption? Honesty? Transparency? How would you define corruption? Corruption is self-centred, having an agenda benefiting the self, lacking the consideration for the whole. We need a more altruistic approach. The wikipedia definition of corruption is crime, linguistics, computing, dishonest or fraudulent conduct by those in power. So when you corrupt corruption, you take the corrupt word and turn it backwards and unteach the teaching of corruption. Take the Mandela effect, how facts & figures are bleeding back through as a counter corruption. When you take a word and turn in backwards it becomes its own opposite.
Q: QUARANTINE GRID lifted in 2016 – any update? It is still an open border. The scaredy cats have already fled early and others are waiting till the last minute. Those are the ones that are holding onto their power, they won’t leave until the power is taken away from them. It is now down to the zealots. We have enough positive light forces and light ships amassed in the Solar System that there can't be another counter invasion on our timeline. There are enough physical beings of light and ships here, in fact billions of ships in this binary system that we are in. We all have the opportunity to  start connecting to them as much as they are trying to contact us on an individual basis.
ANCIENT FOUNDER TECHNOLOGY
Q: What is the yellow box technology? The yellow box is the highest level of technology which was used to predict what humanity on a DNA level would do over thousands of years of evolution. It was a piece of founder technology that allowed the founders to go deep into potentialities of history to create unique micro changes that would allow natural co-creative evolution instead of forcing evolution all the time.  The yellow box predicts the future, a technology that was founded to show the lines of potential future.  There are three yellow boxes in total, two are controlled by the USA, one in Las Vegas and one in Pine Gap in Australia and there is one in Germany. All three boxes would normally give you a line of potentials that all agree upon but the one in Germany no longer agrees with the other two that are controlled by the Americans. So two out of the potential three timelines have a much greater potential but the one in Germany shows a complete alternate potential and possibility that does not correlate to the other two boxes. In the 70 years using the boxes this has never happened. As of 2015 they have not been in sink. The reason why they are out of sink is because there are too many time travel scenarios, too many alternate timelines. They polluted too much. The people that are running the global narrative, the cabal, the hollow earthers, external sources that are keeping this homeostasis that we are stuck in right now, they have done so much time travel manipulation that the boxes don't work together anymore. It is only a matter of time until another American controlled  yellow box shows an alternate timeline and they are no longer in agreement with each other.
Q: What does that mean to the cabal’s process?  If they are all out of sink it could mean that their own system has betrayed itself with a time line that they missed? There is a 5th column or RESISTANCE FREE EARTH finally has done some positive time travel, something that has made a powerful butterfly effect that they didn’t predict. We are coming to a point to where the two boxes that are agreeing now will not agree anymore and then the last box in Germany is not going to confirm the cabal’s prediction model. Then we are in a very unique scenario where the Hollow Earthers have to exert control over the entire apparatus and infrastructure of control on the surface. Then the externals, positive and negative aliens, have to exert control to keep the Hollow Earth people underground and the mass apparatus of infrastructure and control here is going to go: Whose side do we choose?
Q: How does this yellow box technology work? They are working on the basis of the law of the universe – harmony, frequency, vibration law of attraction and repulsion. If a line of potential is very positive and they know its outcome humanity will naturally be attracted to it. If the boxes are showing them 75 lines of potential they know that 75% of the people will get to that and the other 25% will go the opposite way as they are not a match to that. They are still trying to manipulate timelines and create micro changes before, during and past elections, no matter who is president in the States. The front man who runs the senate, the Vice President is an energetic as much as a physical power seat. The Vice President is a ritualistic person that has  constantly energy thrown at him just like the president. The Vice President has a mechanical function in the unseen actions of the cabal.
History has been rewritten 100%. We, as multifunctional and multidimensional beings of awareness, experience parallel timelines as if they are linear. Our linear history is stitched together with pieces taken from all different timelines and run by the global narrative and their teachers who replace the history books every 30-40 years. For example part of the prediction process would be: I need you on this timeline in 1985 and in 1986 you go on another timeline. They are constantly changing people’s citizenships between timelines and try to execute control over the paralleled side timelines.  Our main consciousness is trying to resolve karma and create dharma and people started to resist those manipulations. This is when they had to create more and more side timelines to maintain a level of linear global narrative and they were using the yellow boxes to predict those with.
Q: How do offworld abductions work with regards to DNA farming   When they put you on a different timeline, a lot of times women, they may not realise it but they may have been pregnant 50 times with an offworld foetus, or a clone of yourself. People can have egg and sperm come together in an external source, put inside them for six to seven hours and then take it out and sometimes that is done 200-300 times to people so that foetus has a signature frequency match to this linear time so it can be switched to other times. They use the sperm & egg technology as part of the source time frequency and their breeding programs. We are a farm and they are farming us for our consciousness which is easily weaponised. Indoctrinated belief systems are used to put us onto alternate timelines without ever telling us that we have been transferred just because we belief in what we are being told. We have all these genetic programs from the off world; good, bad and indifferent as well as the genetic Hollow Earth programs who keep us trapped into the farm. Then there is the astral world with its galactic spiritual commerce. The thinkers, mathematicians, philosophers wanting to come here to earth and get the their double PHD’s in the school of hard knocks. Once we are done with that we get to teach the rest of the whole universe.
ADD THE YELLOW BOX QUESTION & ANSWER GAME FROM EARLIER THIS YEAR – EARTH NOUVEAY INSPIRATION TABLET
CHAPTER IV: THE I AM INDIVIDUATION PROCESS OF THE I AM & ENTITIES
Before looking at the I AM Individuation process in more detail we need to understand the bigger perspective 
of the imprint of time and space within consciousness. Time is irreversible and there is no linearity to it. As we know by now energy is indestructible. Every moment within a time-space equation creates an energetic imprint that cannot be erased. No two physical objects occupy space simultaneously, there is no simultaneous or identical history as they follow a unique light path. We as a standing cine wave of existence, as the I AM Apex in embodiment now, are in resonance or dissonance with our previous and future source streams.  The quantum hologram carries the complete history of each energetic imprint of all source streams within this TIME LINE PARADOX.
 Q: The I AM in a TIME LINE PARADOX? You have mighty I AM selves in the past where you were an extremely powerful energy being compared to what you are now. As part of karmic resolution you gave away your I AM self sovereignty to conduct timeline recovery operations. Those ancient I AMs plus another 40, 50 I AM selves spread all over timelines and dimensions are still making decisions that can altering your present choices which gives you an understanding why so many people are unsuccessful in this present world. When you have two or more present selves making choices in a free willed universe, one choice counters another choice. Then you have another layer of definition of paradox where you have one presence self that is on a very high energy earth and another presence self that is on a very low energy earth, one can be easily dominated over the other and vice versa. Reclaiming your sovereignty is to claim back your authority from all high energy versions of yourself in competition and hierarchy and to remove your citizenship from all involved organisations so that all your shards, parts and avatars can leapfrog forward in time and begin the process of claiming unity consciousness to remedy the paradox.
Q: How do we as an I AM presence now jump timelines? That is a very common thing.  It is when you are transiting timelines to figure out which is the optimal timeline to be on. It can also be involuntary, a form of harvesting yes, when you get purposely thrown off your timeline or have chunks taken out of you and put onto a different timeline which can happen easily as our DNA is technology. Entire ancestral lineages are being harvested like that for eons of time. There comes a point where the harvesting ends and you have to make a final choice to be here now with your friends and family. A scenario like that would be planned at prebirth and is often facilitated through a form of traumatic experience in this lifetime getting you to the time line you want to be on. A good way of working through such traumas and dramas is to look at a set of old pictures and get in touch with the you at the various stages of your life to bring memories to the surface and look for pattern recognition. People are often born onto the wrong timeline, the soul knows it and has to go through trials and tribulations to get back to where it needs to be. The dreaming body as the main time travelling technology facilitates those changes and depending on the person one can be super connected or completely disconnected from dreamtime.
Q: What is the individuation process of I AM explained through the use of an I AM Agency? The mighty I AM APEX Presence co-creating SELF has come into this world now as a representation of all your sentients that incarnated into this world before and as such has decision making power for all of your celestial minds of your past, present and future lives. ONLY THE EVER PRESENT MIGHTY I AM SELF IN THE NOW CAN MAKE CHOICES IN CO-CREATION WITH THE UNITY CONSCIOUSNESS WORLD. In other words the I AM APEX PRESENCE OF THE NOW is the ultimate choice mechanism of this lifetime and other aspects of your self can provide the information in which you can make choices on. The ever presence is literally all of your other selves in dominion with the IAM presence now that is resolving contracts with soul family, soul planets or whatever else you are experiencing in this reality. You, as the I AM Apex presence, are deeply honoured by all the ancestors because you are in an ongoing co-creation with the world to expand consciousness as a global community of transformers and consciousness explorers.
The essence of this universe is free will of the I AM presence now.  The soul & higher self  are included but the higher self does not get to make choices only the I AM presence does right here, right now. The higher self can counsel but it can’t give you the questions only answers. When your history has been eliminated it puts you into a paradox of paradoxes because you don’t understand who you truly are and you may not even have any questions to ask. This is often an indication that there are parts of yourself making decisions for you without you being involved. Those paradoxes can be 40 or 50 I AMs at the time working on self-destruction rather than your evolution. You can’t destroy other I AMs but you can work with them, heal or ban them through your free willed choices and actions within the authority as this I AM Apex presence of the now.
Q: What is the Higher self and how do we connect to it? You are already the higher self. The I Am is here in time, as constructed by the higher self during womb planning and the higher self is holographically interacting with you at all times. The I AM here now is based off several previous I AM selves who have gone through life reviews and set up a theme of karma or dharma for this lifetime. In the first five years of so you fully activate your I AM technology, and the rest of the I AM comes in during puberty. Your higher self remains the sacred neutral observer throughout all your incarnations. When you die you meet your Higher Self  again that is in contact with your 10,000 past and future generations of other selves. The I AM is the technology of interface with the God Source that is already within you. You have to learn to get to know yourself as the embodied spiritual human to understand your soul’s purpose and missions.
 Q: What is an I AM Agency? We are using agencies here as a metaphor to explain the subject matter. AGENCIES ARE MADE UP OF ENERGIES OF PRE-IAM EXISTENCES OUTSIDE OF TIME. Whilst the I AM is finite in time those energies are still entangling with you in this lifetime. Those agencies are not always operating at the highest standards and practices like the precognitive workforce does. There are times where you have a contract that can only be resolved in hight frequency and you have to go to work with low quality agencies to resolve karma. You can sack an agency and agents outside agencies. Culture is an external factor that influences the themes of agencies and agents that interact and work with the I AM.
 Think of it like that:
 -        The agency is your first point of contact when you are a foetus in the womb; together with your higher self it is responsible for creating all spiritual contracts for this lifetime.
-        The employer of the agency is you, the human, the IAM this lifetime.
-        The employees or agents of the agency are the various pre I AMs, representing the many yous in the unseen; they often don't always work in unison and sometimes to take over the agency.
 The you of today, were once a foetus in your mother’s womb. The foetus knows that it will need a variety of experiences to plan infinite potentials and works hand I hand with the agency to make a series of contracts to fit the karmic resolution.
It is very well possible that there is another foetus in another mother’s womb that is you too. Remember your soul is far too big to just fit into one DNA body and simultaneous existing bodies as part of your soul expression are common. This foetus may have worked with an agency in the past that now works with and for you. The more efficient the agency works the more often you will reuse it through your many foetus plans. Some of them are low quality agencies and they can mess up the matching of your I AM. Often an employee of an agency has worked with several other I AMs and has a good working relationship and reputation.
 The foetus, as it comes through the birthing canal goes into the great forgetting and starts unfolding its own awareness around two years old, the terrible two’s. It is no longer directly working with the first point of contact in the agency alone. The I AM baby is settling into the new DNA skinsuit and is also learning from and through the parents and the environment. As a baby you have full access to the vagus nerve which means you are still connected to the mystical side of this existence at a larger level. The vagus nerve is like a control room, it operates the body with its special skills. The I AM is housed in the vagus nerve and as such it has access to the entire consciousness DNA experience machine. As the I AM gets older it works with different levels of authority with the agency and oftentimes at puberty the I AM fires the existing agency. Why? Think of it as the I AM saying I have to be a sovereign being in this lifetime and as such I need to take back my sovereignty from all these I AMs represented by the agencies. Most of that happens subconsciously because of the level of hormones that are driving you during puberty. In conclusion, the I AM APEX presence here now has the power to boot out other I AMs if they are trying to run the agenda through the IAM Apex now by employing corrupt agencies or soul families. Agencies can also be shared by soul families.
Q: You are talking about a bankrupt I AM what is it? That would be someone who gave up responsibility of creating their reality and hand over authority to the programs and former I AM’s. A person that, in a post life review, probably chose not to cross over right away and hung around as a temporary ghost. This can create a longer form of shadowing and fractionalised soul shards.  When finally crossing over the I AM no longer has a point of contact to assist with the life review and future foetus planning.  There are times where a living person has become a bankrupt I AM or has given all authority away.
Having said that we are living in a free willed universe and you can always make another choice to remedy old choices. The I AM Apex has the power to outcreate itself. This means that an I AM at any point can go into the vagus nerve and begin the journey of self- mastery, self-healing, self-nurturing and kick out the negative programs that are in there. There are times where you have given authority to a protective part of you, a program, a self-created demon, that takes the authority and says I get to work with the agencies you don’t and it doesn’t fill you in in any of the emails or memos. If shitty things just happen in people’s lives they are usually not in their I AM, they are not fully in their body and vagus nerve, they are not in the driver seat. False synchronicities can be created when an I AM’s who has had enough soul shards in them, the soul shards begin to take over the I AM SPOT in the vagus nerve and then begin to contract with the actual agency in unawareness of the I AM that has made the original contracts. In order to step back into the mighty I AM Apex it will then take, daily practice, courage and determination to continue the work of self-mastery without the neediness of instant gratification and external validation.
Q: To what degree are these agencies competing against each other? Agencies can work in multiple time-space equations. Agents inside the agency are certified to work in time and no time. Some agents work with other uncertified agents of other time-space equations for the purpose of forcing a match no matter how minute it is. Agents and the agency are separate entities. Think of them as independent contractors who are contracted by an agency to do the work.  Some agents are full time employees and some are outsourced contractors. Like when a bank sells a product and bets against what they are selling you. Even though the 'karmic resolution machine' has run its course, we as beings still are attempting to reincorporate our fractured selves, our traumatised and charged perspectives. This allows the agencies to use those traumatic experiences as a perspective for matching us to let go of karma and work towards dharma.
Q: Are the agencies contracted out in the womb still working with the manifested beings in the now? Yes,  they are still working with you in the now. As long as domination and control still exist, where we are forced to accept tens of millions of layers seen and unseen, we will be dealing with agencies and contracted agents of agencies who have three degrees of separation from the responsibility of the destruction they cause for someone who is not equal to the level of awareness during this time of awakening.
Q: What can we do about I AMs working against us? Contract revocations, shamanic work, daily practice of self-mastery. Remember, we all have those, we all have parts of us that work for the domination and control agency.  We have I AMs that work for thousands of different agencies throughout the universe.  High level shamanic work is getting rid of the one star agencies to only start working with the five star ones. Low level agencies have a very low standard of signature frequency match. Higher quality agencies have higher standards of match making. The agency is here to help you write a contract on the fly. That is best resolution for all sides. Low level agencies look for lower levels of resolution to get their quota.
Q: What is THE VAGUS NERVE’s role with regards to the I AM experience? The vagus nerve is the universe in realized potential. The I AM must learn to drive the vagus nerve, being the highway, like a race car driver.  The Schumann resonance is the speed limit sign or no speed limit sign. The agencies like to give you speeding tickets without authority to really slow you down. There are construction zones where the I AM sets up a building phase and at times the I AM creates a rebel who screws up the plans. This is when traumas take over life planning. The foetus gets shut out of this part and tries to get itself back into trust with the I AM. These are the blame, shame, guilt, fear agents that exponentially get worse with age. Faith is a key component to understanding the levels of separation. Loss of faith and trust is loss of control of the vagus nerve. Once you lost control of the vagus nerve you are in a self made crisis ruled by hesitation and doubt. When there is no coherence between mind heart spirit there cannot be a resonance to the seen and unseen world that is trying to align synchronicities to you without you being paranoid of them. You start attracting low quality agencies and the Schumann resonance is there to determine how powerful and potent you can be throughout an era or slice of history. It is only the agencies or self-created internal programs that put on the speed limit signs. The highway goes in every direction but you still have to guide yourself with confidence from point A to point B which is resolution of conscious awareness at the level of responsibility as an I AM of someone who is fully realised in the vagus nerve on the super highway of the self.  The speed limits can be seen as programs that need to be taken out or considered as data and input to learn and evolve. A lot of the conspiracy theory world are speed limits to slow you down. The system of domination and control is a low level agency. Agencies have all different levels of practices and standards.
Q: What are speed limits or construction sites in this metaphor of the vagus nerve? Let’s say you want to go into spirituality and not do the 9-5 job journey so you put in a deliberate constructions zone to limit the speed of any programs that may want to take you off that path. It is how the I AM sets up discipline of the self. Your journey to become a self-illuminated master means that you can’t let your programs influence you making hasty choices that don’t work in our long term favour. Programs bring up a subject matter, they have charge and polarity behind it and as soon as you give into it, the program in the vagus nerve is running you and not the I AM. Constructions zones are all about frequency, vibration and harmony. They are not necessarily a bad thing but here to help you on the path. There are deconstructions zones, where a person has had life long trauma and needs to stop the traffic, completely tear up the roads and create a detour so that there is only one new neural pathway to choose from.
Q: What do you mean by TIME SYNCHING with regards to agencies? Agencies will look for how present you really are so they can match you with a being of similar resonance to your time-space equation. This is what I call time synching.  Once you are in time sync with an agency it can contract for you. People, places, things, objects, art pieces, synchronicities anything that can create an experience that manifests a memory with lasting expressions. Astrology has a big part in how the agencies can work with one. It builds on what sticks in light memory or trauma memory and from there a blueprint is formed. The system of domination looks to predict us the same way and tries to get us to work with its corrupt agency. Thus why so many unprotected technologies are dangerous to the IAM growth because they can time synch with you as if they are a  high quality agency when in reality they are scammers.
Q: What is a spiritual strategy? A spiritual strategy is an agenda in your time-space equation so that things can naturally time synch with you and you are not forcing them. Often people can’t find their perfect mate because they are trying to force matches. It’s a pure energetic thing that does not have a cognitive function behind it. The I AM’s  purpose is to cognitise things in a time-space vocation, to have access to its vagus nerve, equal to its level of awareness so a series of experiences can transcend chemical memories. Those chemical memories become powerful light memories that allow us to remember things about us during the great awakening that is part of ascension into higher states of beingness whilst still present in this world that has all these incoherent factors to them. What are incoherent factors? The political voting system, rules and laws of banking, government, media. All those things that are trying to force a match in a false reality through unprotected technology.
Q: What is the Schumann resonance? The Schumann resonance is background frequency of electromagnetics that is effected by solar winds and radiation, the actual magnetics of the planet. It represents an opportunity where consciousness can rapidly expand. If you feel that you respond to the spikes it might say to you that you have all this electromagnetic thinking juice and you are not doing anything with it. The Schumann resonance is not one number. It is many, like a team dance combination. There is no one common shared Schumann resonance around the world. All of them make up the orchestra of consciousness. Sometimes you have many orchestras playing different interpretations of the classics and at times other playing remixes. Mountains, lakes, deserts and rivers alter the Schumann resonance as well as the seen and unseen life in those areas. Think of the Schumann resonance as the key musicians playing. Through consciousness you are quantumly entangling with the Schumann resonance. Working with our I AM agencies is a choice in awareness or unawareness or both. The Schumann resonance determines the veracity of interaction or speed signs and at times has nothing to do with Schumann rates.  It’s the key that allows things to act in synchronicity, false or real, so that best matching actions, seen and unseen, create powerful manifestations. The quality of the agency will determine the power level and the time of action in a key. Our modern light-worker community has bastardized the Schumann resonance into something that it is not. Idiots with youtube PHDs trying to hypnotize something into an absolute truth. The Schumann resonance is there to keep all living things seen and unseen on one celestial musical key.  Free will allows us to explore many keys that can create resonance with the natural way of living or not. A dissonant state is the cacophony of chaos and chaos is its own universal key.
Q: What is the difference between Consciousness entanglement and a program? A program may or may not be consciously entangled. It all depends on how life force empowered the program is. The more we are out of our body and letting the program run us the more it is entangled with our vagus nerve .  The vagus nerve gives it access to our special skills which often creates a confusion of what is the soul and what is the program. Some people’s bodies are controlled and run by programs that have taken over the vagus nerve and the I AM has no idea. Karma determines the growth and veracity of actions entities take when they take over programs. At times entities don't know they are being run by karma. It is easy to get lost between what is an internally created and what is external entity.
Q:  What are entities and how do we work with them? 99% of all entities are self created with about 1% being external haunting. NOT EVERYONE IS MEANT TO WORK WITH ENTITIES and that is why classification can be not always helpful. There is an intuitive factor to knowing to what to work with and what not. If you don’t have that intuitive factor built in you should not be in that realm. That is what I call CURIOSITY LEARNING. When you let the programs run you. When you are curious about something you are not the neutral observer because you have already charge and polarity out of curiosity itself. You are controlling a subject matter, which is right at the edge of the unknown that the brain is going to fill in the unknown before it is known. Lots of people think they have to know and then they are falsely drawn to it via paranoia. It is the vibration in them saying I need to know about entities so they don’t invade me whilst they might not have had any around for months.
Not everything is an entity! There are certain forms of energy that we define as an entity that have never been one, they are just shards or parts of us. They initially were simply part of the story that we created before they turned into internal programs when the story became empowered through charge and polarity. A trauma can develop from just being a scary story, that does not really effect you, into fully blown fear, anxiety and paranoia. Trauma release can be where you go back to the original story that we over created and seeing the tree of creation for what it really is. This is where many people require external help to get back to that source. Not everyone can do that on their own. There are certain people that have ancestral DNA switches turned on and don't have a capacity for that type of self-inquiry. They would do well with DNA surgery or taking DNA surgery classes, extended DNA surgery journeys to work on the strands of consciousness that are limited.
There are times where the story becomes so strong, the entity takes over the life-force and the person finds it impossible to disentangle. The next wave of healers needs to come out where their frequency, vibration and harmony is enough to erode those stories. As one of those healers you’ve got to slow down.  Don’t go beyond the match of your vibration. Remember, the house always wins and you never know what is next when people are being possessed. Yes, you are the alpha entity but self-defeating habit patterns can make your potential a low match to high vibration. Getting out of shame, blame and guilt is the beginning of the healing journey.
When you are speaking to a client that is run by an entity you usually talk to both. You are speaking to the client and the entity simultaneously because the person is both an entangled and unentangled observer in that scenario. When I say speaking to the entity, your plan of conduct is to make the entity come out to a conversational match so you can speak to it. The client can be a fully unentangled observer listening to you talking to the entity even though he or she is using her vocal cords to respond to its thoughts.
Q: What does it mean when people are forcing their SIGNATURE FREQUENCIES onto you?! This is when people work with very low quality agencies to create. They often use you as a match to get others into their web as they find it difficult to  be on their own or need instant gratification and constant validation for their ideas and creations. As a healer or teacher you will see that a lot of people faux match themselves with you. I immediately sense when this happens and it helps me understand if my teaching will make a difference or not. This is part of knowing who you work with and what is required for the person to hear and for me to say or not to say.  With that approach I can assist them making memories but they can still be bastardised and altered by their ego. I go to extreme levels of spiritual strategy to deweaponise scenarios like that. When you know it is a  faux match you can use it to your advantage that does not create karma. Depending on the power of your vibration, if  potent enough, their alter ego has to retreat and their I AM can feel the vibration. The altered ego is usually a chicken shit. WHEN THE I AM HAS TO DEFEND ITS ACTIONS IT SHOWS YOU HOW UNSOVEREIGN IT REALLY IS. You have to maintain a high vibration not to let chaos define the key notes.
Q: What are shattered shards of IAMs?  These are either bankrupt or fractionalised I AMs that are not authorised to deal with an agency but still take on this responsibility without your authority. We all come across these forms during the healing and teaching journey. Take someone who has been sexually abused at a young age using an altered ego to protect themselves emotionally. Then they go through healing and they no longer need that shard or they use chemical, drugs and create more shards, demons, vigilantes falsely protecting them.
Q: What is an external demon? It is a lifeforce that has not crossed over and maintains itself as a surface bound energy spirit draining off  lifeforce from others as it cannot produce its own light. It could be an I AM that didn’t want to pass over or an offworld being that could live thousands of years but lost its capacity maintaining a single body. Its I AM can create new bodies temporarily but the vibration of this world does not allow these bodies to stay in existence long enough and that is why it uses other bodies in a parasitic format.
Q: What is an Internal demon? In general an internal demon is a result of intense trauma and drama. The story becomes so big that that character goes into the vagus nerve and the subconscious empowers it to be the potent being. Then it becomes the dictator, tyrant and abuser through addictions, self-defeating habits, self-sabotaging mutilations. The person’s internal demons will try to dominate and control the external demons because of that person not validating the abuse. External demons  often do a runner as the internal demons can be very strong and destructive.
Q: What is an implanted entity? It is a powerful demon that has thousands of ways harvesting energies off you, controls many sub minion demons that are much younger under the hierarchy of a more powerful demon. It will implant into you and its job is to pretend to be your inner higher voice until you won’t be able to distinguish what is your voice and what is the demon’s voice.
Q: What is an explanted entity? Something that has been put inside you to create a signature frequency match and then purposely has been ripped out to create a drama. Once outside of you it will still vibrate on your frequency serving as a bait to lead you down a track of false synchronicities to negative external sources. 
Q: What is an Inculcated entities? That’s what I call advanced puppetry – you don’t know who or what is pulling the strings – a very old external demon source that has lines into thousands of minions that are feeding up the tree.
Q: What is a clone? When you create a clone of a person, you have to have a spark of that person in the clone that has a similar spiritual contract pattern to it. It is against sovereign free will rules to collect an entity’s DNA and make a clone of it. Cloning against someone’s free will creates a person that is dominated and controlled with little to no sovereignty. This would enable other sentients to take over the body at any point. The vast majority of the worlds trade beings genetically built with a suit for consciousness to broadcast from one planet to another. That suit can be inhabited for a period of time and then put into cold storage for further later use or they unmanifest the body, travel energetically to a planet and re-manifest a body there.
Q: How do you deal with people who are run by entities in a session? I am asking myself what choices in the now will they make? Are they going to lie or avoid the questions as their truth. If they choose to tell the truth and be authentic even in their lies then we have to start unravelling their programs. I am not battling the programs. I am giving the soul an opportunity to step into the body to stop the programs arguing for their limitations. THIS IS ME FLIPPING THE FREQUENCY on the person so the program loses its power. This usually works for kicking out entities. Running into a fully depressed person can be tiring and it is important to know the difference when you speak to the person or a program, an internal demon. Now, when the person is in the body, the programs are shut off, sometimes external entities can still come in. At that point I can out vibrate the energy by being fully present but it can still come back another time. This is when I do the REPEAT AFTER ME PROCESS, where I am getting them to acknowledge the trauma that was there, dissolving the fake signature frequency match that it is using to be inside them. Oftentimes the entity is repeating the words as it doesn’t know what I am making it do and I can get the entity to pass on out of its own language. As the client or caller goes into emotional release there is the process, communication between the caller and the entity as the house of cards falls down.
There are people with powerful external or internal entities in them they have become subjugated to. You can hear it in their voice how meek they are. There is no power in their voice and by the end of the session the voice has changed.  These callers coming into their bodies and I am reseeding the natural sympathetic and parasympathetic coding by the I AM coming back into the vagus nerve so that it doesn’t dominate them and it can trigger emotional release which is often stopping people, they can’t have an emotional release.
At other times their celestial medium is fully speaking to that person and they have fingers in their ears etc. They may be perceiving the communication but they are not getting anything. Their higher soul is getting a message of how to recalibrate its process as that person’s foetus in the womb’s blueprint does not have enough foundational pieces for them to make that manifestation of the original infinite blueprint. I am giving an updated code to the higher self on how to make it happen in the framework of this memory that is there for that person during this frequency of time for them to do something with it. That is soul surgery. Linguistic alchemy.
Q: How does one make sure that the person does not invite the entity back in? You can’t ensure that and it will be down to the persons choices. It is part of the follow up, emphasising the importance of daily practice, sacred neutral perspective, self-healing and mastery to consistently raise and maintain their frequency so that the memory is going to stick to keep the entity out.  I have an understanding that the experience itself is going to create a memory, are they going to bastardise it or not, that’s a different story. Some people have such destructive habitual patterns as well as rebels that just refuse to conform with any changes. Being a rebel might have been vital to get out of the soul family they weren’t supposed to be in and now it is working against them as they are not committing to themselves by being overly identified with their rebel persona.
Q: What is psychic soul surgery? That is the super illuminal me, using conscious aware Andrew talking and the super illuminal experience to travel to spaces, timestreams, dimensions, galaxies and universes where shards are locked out of the frequency of the being. My voice is creating a portal for them to return and the many precognitive mes are preparing and healing the shards so  they can go back and re-integrate into their fractional. There is obviously body language that goes with that. There are times where individual pieces and codes are being pulled out and cannot be brought back to the body as they are too negative, as part of the reintegration phase. You have seen me use my hands to  separate data. I don’t need to do the hand language but it makes it a lot easier for me talking to you as I am making the body part of the experience. The body has more CPU power so I can do it show after show. I have my own prepared space and energy for that and the super illuminal capacity of my thought power can bring in all the energies that are needed and prepare the shards. There are certain shards where I have to talk the person through to get them back in, that’s that repeat after me process, because they have to consciously bring it in. I can only bring those shards to the edge of their aura and if they don’t want them I have to take them back.
CHAPTER V: MODERN DNA MANIPULATION (3), CORRUPTION & RETURN TO NATURAL LIVING, ADVANCED SPIRITUALITY (Chat 6)
Duality is to see the distorted and the undistorted hologram for what it is and choose which one is real to you. Let’s look at some of the technologies that have impacted our perception of reality. The meaning of technology is related to the forceful creation & manipulation through the system of energy harvest versus natural evolution through harmonised and unified living. Negative DNA farming is still going on right now. The negative species needed to take control of the farms and therefore they had to put limiting factors into various skinsuits reaching back 75,000 years ago.
 
Q: How did the negative species manipulate our DNA? The CEREBELLUM, in the medulla oblongata, in the back of the brainstem is now part of the autonomic nervous system. That was not always so, it used to be called the tiny back up brain. There are other reptilian species that have two and three brains because of their giant bodies. The Cerebellum was implemented into skinsuits to impede on our evolution and to stop us from doing rituals and ceremonies that would shed light on the fake masters and gods all those years ago. In modern times MEDICINE was brought into this holographic reality to stunt our growth and use the global narrative to distort and distract us from remembering our true nature. In the ancient times the hologram was very different as the global narrative was based on what the ‘gods’ were telling us. The cerebellum is the limiting factor for faith itself. The master DNA creators incorporated the cerebellum into the DNA by adding a rung, like creating a new organ, so we would not progress beyond certain experiences and awaken from the fact that we are a farm. Our motor cortex used to be actively in alignment with our heart, brain and gut before. Nowadays the cerebellum is completely integrated into our heart, brain, gut complexity and interacts as a medium with our reality keeping us in fight, flight & freeze to limit our journey. The cerebellum can hinder us from having astral travel experiences. We can overwrite its function, like we do in the Advanced Heart Meditation where we turn off the medulla oblongata to create a super highway between the brain and heart in order to reconnect those two organs. As our skinsuits evolve through the journey of self-mastery, the influx of light and the DNA crystallisation process we can change the cerebellum’s function and re-integrate it back into the brain.
Q: What other modern DNA farming alterations have been done to the DNA skinsuit? What do you know about the SPHENOID BONE? The sphenoid bone is the one with the great wings, just behind the eye sockets, below the frontal bone. It joins many of the other bones in the skull. When working on the sphenoid bone in CST we impact on the other bones in the skull and the face. The sphenoid bone was radically manipulated so that our residual image would alter during our emotional journeys. How? When you are depressed your eyes sockets will be influenced through the sphenoid bones, the ears, the mandibles, the jaw position, how the sinuses are effected, how much air can come in and out of the nose. The sphenoid bone was manipulated and integrated into the facial structure so we wear our emotions on our sleeves that allows programs to take over sympathetic and parasympathetic control. Sphenoid alignment is one of the greatest emotional releases one can have. It interlinks with the parietal, temporal, zygomatic, the cheek bones. In CST when we hold the occiput and we feel for the movement of the sphenoid bone, people with imbalances there, are usually suffering. It is the gyroscope of the face which is linked to residual image and also linked to our capacity to being in the body recognising our residual image.
Our INNER EAR BONES determine how we literally hear the tones in our reality. Some people are tone deaf. It is our early infant journey that determines how robust these bones grow as we are aligning to the space time motion and our spiritual center of gravity. The size of these bones has been greatly reduced to versus what they should be, about quadruple the size. This is to hinder us from connecting to sound and motion. One of the tiniest bones of the body, the stirrup bone, is in the ear. If those bones in the ears would be bigger we would be more spiritually centered and programs would have less power over us.
THE EYE LASHES not only keep dirt out and protect the eyes but they are also antennas just like cats whiskers. We cannot always see them as we blink our eyes but they are very much part of our visionary spiritual journey. Just like cats use their whiskers as a sensing system, we use our eye lashes to assist us psychically. Our tongue and eye lashes have been modified to allow the cerebellum to take control over motion action. If they were not directly hijacked we would be able to see all the other layers of reality.
HAIR are antennas too. Each different skinsuit has a different quality to hair. Our hair today when you cut it is dead whilst in the old days it stayed alive. Alpaca hair under the microscope is alive as the tubes allow light to continuously refract through them. Our hair should be the same way. In the military they shave off men’s hair to be able to control them better. The wind talkers, the Native Americans, had thick long hair that helped them decode messages of the wind using light language. Much like the eye lashes hair allows us to input data from other realities and it is fair to say that the hair as a system has also been hijacked by the cerebellum. There are other aspects in the cerebrum that have hijacked hair because it is linked to our scalp which is related to our central location system of our file tree. Lots of people have the round bold patch right on top of their head. That is a representation that their DNA is limiting certain parts of their crown chakra.
THE FUNNY BONE inside the elbow is a big nerve ganglion that has grown out of proportion to impact on how the skeletal system interacts with the vagus nerve. It bypasses the skeletal system so that we are feeling more through the flesh than the bones. When your bones and hair are in sympathetic alignment you get that feeling of your hair standing up at the back of your neck. They increased the funny bone in size so that it was more data oriented than the bones. By being more aware of the muscle than the bone you gain strength faster to be able to lift heavy loads. This is how the manipulation through the cerebellum sourced and maintained the slave communities.
MENS NIPPLES – at one point the DNA skinsuit could switch from male to female at will. The men’s nipples remained because they could not remove them when they started modifying our bodies for procreational versus recreational pleasures as another form of control. Remember as technology we are supposed to be self-entertaining, self-educating, self-evolving based off what our global narrative tells us to adapt to.
MEN’S ADAMS APPLE – another control system to limit men’s sovereignty through the projection of the voice through the I AM evolution during puberty. The loss and gain of innocence was hugely controlled in the DNA through the DNA lineages.
We have 33 VERTEBRATES IN THE SPINE instead of 40. The side wings of the vertebrates should be a more robust expression. Our spinal column has less vertebrates and they are bigger. We should have smaller ones and seven more with greater space in between the vertebrates to allow more plasticity of the body itself. When you have less vertebrates it is easier to become bogged down with depression programs. In some offworld DNA skinsuits they have 72 vertebrates and a greater brain processing power. Each vertebrate is a part of the brain stem connected to the vagus nerve and cerebellum. If you take out the cerebellum the entire skeletal spinal column is an extension of the brain which is still the case just not highly functioning. More vertebrates allow more interaction with the chakras beyond the crown. Giraffes have a bigger processing power just like the Brontosaurus that had a neck to be 90 feet long. Imagine a bearded Brontosaurus with all that wisdom and flexibility.
Our EYES & OUR THIRD EYE have been manipulated too. The function of the  3rd eye and our pineal gland have been hijacked by the cerebellum at birth. Once you cut the umbilical cord the cerebellum takes over the special awareness instead of having the 3rd eye remain in charge of awareness until puberty. A baby with the 3rd eye engaged at birth without cutting the cord would have a radically different perceptive capacity.
Our EYE COLOUR is an aspect of the DNA and directly connected to the residual image. A child can choose its eye colour by changing it in the first few months. It is flowing through the cranio sacral system projecting light out of the eyes through the lense of their colour.
The THYMUS GLAND has been manipulated too and it still comes back to the cerebellum implant. If you take the cerebellum out all of those manipulated and corrupted capacities would return back to normal. At this stage of our development the cerebellum cannot be surgically removed without rendering the patient brain dead. Due to the holographic reality we live in there are people who have 60% of their brain gone because of an accident and they are still alive and aware.
When it comes to the APPENDIX the original purpose, during times of natural living, was to help process vegetable matter that was very difficult to break down. The function of the appendix is not greatly understood now and it is often removed. It still helps to balance the gut gnome to dampen candida, amplify other micro organisms and to put nutrients into the gut system to support digestions.
The original purpose of TONSILS was a filtration system for airborne bacteria. They close off the air passage way to the lungs and act as a portal for fluid, like gills, for other atmospheric type journeys. Depending on the skinsuit it will or will not change the sound of the voice when removed. The removal can impact on the potency of the voice projection.
When it comes to TEETH & WISDOM TEETH in certain DNA skinsuits wisdom teeth have to come out for the jaw to function. Those are aspects that are being inserted to limit the body. These teeth will rot and if you don’t take them you will be greatly limited. Dentistry in the ancient history was a death sentence usually. The name ‘wisdom’ tooth itself is a play and imprint on the belief system. The teeth are intricately linked to the nervous system and are a vital part of what goes into our gut. Teeth help us to relate to our residual images and some people can gain more of their reality through a set of fake teeth. Heavy metal fillings, like mercury, create a bioelectric frequency that can distort all of the nerve endings and the chemical reactions in there. Teeth are often connected to entities as they hijack the gut through the teeth.
The SHAPE OF THE ORGANS are determined by the size of the vertebrates. More and smaller vertebrates would impact on the organs. Everybody’s skinsuit has different shapes of organs. This is the medical industry’s deep, dark secret. Many people that have what I call ‘upside down organs’ quite literally. It is not a DNA flaw it is just like consciousness in the DNA lineage is organised differently to allow a different experience. The organs are shaped differently depending on the skinsuit, there is not one position of them which will change our consciousness being or in the vagus nerve, the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system. Another aspect of our manipulated DNA is that there are many DNA skinsuits, outside of EARTH that have a second heart, located in the intestinal tract, that creates extended peristaltic. The cerebellum is no longer the cerebellum it is another heart, controlling the micro pressure of blood flowing through the brain allowing brain, heat, gut coherence. In the growth of the foetus the heart is the 1st  organ, the tongue is the 2nd , the 3rd  is our lymph system – the thymus, the 4th and 5th would be the gut heart. The high heart would take over the cerebellum.
Q: Some examples on modern medicine with regards to the DNA manipulation?
-        Antidepressants can change the chemistry of the brain to distract from the trauma and dramas locked in the various places and spaces in the body without solving the associated karma.
-        Take the contraceptive pill as another example? It gets prescribed to young women to help balance out the flow of menstrual blood and assist mood swings. Women often build up immunity to it and need to experiment with different ones. This can be emotionally stressful and physically as well as it can affect aspects of their sexual experience which prevents a lot of women from having true orgasms.
-        Cannabis can stop muscle pain without going on opioids. Unfortunately in most countries cannabis are still illegal. Lots of people are paranoid not wanting to take them for patriotic reasons or don't understand the medicinal value versus recreational drug abuse.  .
-        Blood Pressure Medication is being handed it out generously and can create dependencies and can lead to strokes.
-        Statin drugs are said to increase risk of new-onset diabetes in patients. Any diabetic who wants to heal needs to control their food and sugar consumption as well as have more awareness of what their body & soul requires. They often have alcohol addiction in their ancestral lineage over many lifetimes dating back to poisonous water resources where people drank alcohol instead. Their food was inadequate and they led a very acidic life in the old days. The lineage may have a propensity to create diabetes as a DNA flaw to claim back health and resolve that ancestral karma. There can also be biological ancestral DNA flaws as a result of inbreeding. Diabetes has been around for thousands of years. In the old days people just went into a coma and died and they called that an early natural death.
-        Allergies are caused by DNA flaws mostly produced form early plastics and petroleum products that were truly poisonous to the users and through landfills. In the early industrial age chimneys produced toxic emissions all the way back to 300 years ago, when producing smelting canons. These flaws inevitably created over long term were incorporated into the plans of the system of domination and control. They had a prediction on what it would create to get people out of their ancestral homes into cities.
 
Q: What do you mean when you talk about Technology? When I use the word technology I am talking about anything  that creates a forced versus a natural evolution be that now within or outside of the DNA. When it comes to technology there is always the fear factor of the technology itself that can be counterproductive to any use and integration. Technology is vitally important for us as an ever evolving species. Take chemtrails as an example. On the one hand chemtrails got weaponised through creating fear in the population. On the other hand the exposure can be seen as tool for people to wake up and become more aware of what is going on and how we are being manipulated through the system of domination & control. From an akashic Records view CHEMTRAILS can block out galactic energies that are coming in. Combine that with fluoride and all the other additives in our food consumption it can limit our ability to maintain and raise to higher levels of consciousness.
 
Q: What role does the Pineal Gland play and how does it get manipulated? Our environment interacts with the DNA instruments through the pineal gland. Fluorides create a crystalline structure in the fluid sac of the pineal gland. The purpose of this crystalline structure is to take scalar wave information from etheric satellites to influence your local dreamtime in the sacred geometry cities. Transformers on the light poles along the streets can create an omnidirectional field that interacts with the crystals in your pineal gland to keep you trapped and not get into global dreamtime. The plugs in your room, your TV sets, computers, routers, all create an electromagnetic field that can suppress the pineal gland. Whilst the decalcification of the pineal gland is a good thing it is important not to fall into the trap of fear around it that can create more damage than the idea of decalcification itself.
 
Q: Can you say more on the manipulation through Cern? CERN is a large hadron collider in France. The Council of Twelve, used Cern to “fudge the numbers” of the audit by the Prime Creator in March 2013 and it had other functions too. The idea was to use it as a teleportation device. If the consciousness would raise to a level of where domination loses control over humanity they would teleport Earth back into a denser part in the Solar System and get the people to dream themselves back into unawareness. Remember, we are manifesting, co-creating beings on the graduation timeline. All other planets are intricately linked into that graduating timeline and all other spirits in that timeline can literally impact on our awakening.
Q: What are some examples of that energy harvesting technology you speak of?
1.  	Influence of shoes as a technology in time & space disconnecting us from the benefits of the earth energies. Research has shown that barefoot contact with the earth can produce instant changes in physiological issues as well as reduce stress and improve the immune system. Earthing is recommended to connect to Earth’s surface electrons unhindered by shoes no longer just made of leather.
2.  	Mirrors as a technology:  brought in as a way to enhance and de-enhance consciousness. Reflective surfaces, the implicate observation of the self. Portals where brought in later and added to the reflective surface. Mirrors allowed more negative aspects for beings that weren’t ready for the exploration. Vanity, ego and other reflection teachings are used to masterfully manipulate and distort the self-image and the relationship with the world. Then there is the residual image through all lifetimes which is influenced by reflective based technology.
3.  	RESIDUAL IMAGE is something the soul, the avatar uses to distinguish itself between incarnation. Every incarnation has its own image. If you are in the same lineage over and over again your residual image would be an amalgamation of all the previous images. As you are existing in many lineages you will look differently all the time. RESIDUAL IMAGE ATTACK…?
4.  	PHOTOGRAPHS can play a role too. They are an enhanced reflective technology that is a direct manifestation of alchemy. It captures a slice of light in which the consciously entangled observer can see unmanifested matter by reflection of what that time spaced environment in light looks like. Our eyes can only see a certain band of frequency that the picture captures even though our DNA instrument as a whole can perceive data beyond the sense of sight through our intuition. The limit photographic view can freeze some of the energetics if the entangled observer falls for the limitation through their belief engine. It comes back to how manipulative reflective technology can be. It has significantly changed the reflections and re-interpretations of history together with the limitations created through the judgment process inherent in unconscious observation. 
-        BRANDS can effect each one of us individually in our bubbles of reality and also through the use of commonly shared technology. Whilst we are not fully aware we need to use technology to connect us with all co-creating realities as part of the greater journey of awakening. Every computer has a brand behind them which is a significant portion of the Global Narrative. Like for this mac to be produced there is all the Chinese slave labour to put it together and same goes for our cell phones. Any piece of technology is built on the shoulders of living generations which allow a collaboration between realities. The brand influences the myth how we perceive these technologies. Future realities will not brand and market technology which immediately will take out the myth and the subconscious imprinting onto our DNA.
Q: How do brands  effect our physical movement through the hologram? Do I walk differently using my I-Phone versus a pay as you go? Branding creates competition and hierarchy even if you may not realise it. The brand imprints on you how you move through reality and how you get perceived by others. It’s not cheap either, you have to pay to get and stay connected. We have bought into the payment system and the myth around technology created by the Global Narrative. The Global Narrative is a marketing agency that has got a one star rating only and as such significantly impacts on our I AM Individualisation journey through the debt based system. What happens to our body on the journey of discovering spirit and learning to astral travel, journey within or mediate? Your body might not be in motion but chemically there is still a lot going on. This is an example of aligning the finite I AM with the infinite I AM, the chemical & non-chemical experience simultaneously.
CORRUPTION,  BACK TO NATURAL LIVING & ADVANCED SPIRITUALITY (6)
Q: What level of societal evolution is required to acknowledge rights for all sentient kind and pass spiritually conscious laws? Brazil for instance has recognised the dolphins as intelligent species and other countries are starting to follow suit. If we would reduce the overall global corruption by 35 percent we would be at progressive societal levels to begin to pass laws in line with natural co-creative evolution with all sentient kind and replace the ongoing fight for survival in the 3rd and 4th world countries with natural thrival.
Q: What are the major changes that are required to achieve that 35% reduction in corruption? A good way to start is to look at the corruption through international corporates controlling GLOBAL PRODUCTION. Let’s contemplate the benefits of an evolutionary relationship between humanoids and an automated workforce. The ill advised and propagated doctrine of robots taking over the world, stealing our jobs keeps humanity holding on to self-inflicted limitations. It is easy to fall prey to this with large corporates exploiting the job market by manipulating supply and demand.
The reversal of the false idea of advanced technology bastardising our standards of living would allow us to recognise the benefits to human evolution. We are natural living beings in an ever expanding age of quantum computing and advancing technology is part of our birth right and legacy. Automation, robots can replace a variety of jobs that are dangerous, monotonous, dumbing down the human mind and blinding society to the corrupt corporate empires using and abusing those existential fears to their advantage aiding domination and control.
Understanding the value of automation, a low price high quality robot remotely operated through a computer system purposely designed and controlled by humans building houses, any kind of infrastructure saving valuable limbs, lives, time and spirit opens up massive alternatives to explore human potential. Dangerous jobs can be automated to save human lives. This will still leave a significant amount of labour and jobs that are better facilitated through human application and or in co-creation with robots. Time and money could be freed to dedicate one’s life to the unique vocation and calling to move beyond the incarceration of new age urban slavery.
Part of the corporate corruption is withholding all sorts of alternative technologies that are already available that would give small and medium enterprises as well as every planetary citizen a chance to simplify daily processes and be more productive and profitable in their own entrepreneurial activities and investments instead of being forced having their life force harvested in uninspired 9-5 jobs. Believe it or not integrating robotic assistance in our daily living is part of the natural evolution for advancing humanity.  Combining natural living with technology and making it work is a way of LIVING & OPERATING IN THE CONCRETE JUNGLE. Any jobs lost by the automation would go into techno humanoid concepts – a unique interaction between man & machine. There is no such thing as ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE taking over humanity on this planet . It still requires us to create, install, operate and manage it. The reduction of corruption starting at the level of global production lines can bring back real hope for a complete system change.
The next level is adapting the EDUCATION SYSTEM to reflect the quantum era starting at nursery and primary school level. The school’s curriculum has to include special awareness, art work, working with animals and other sentient creatures to promote a deep connection to the natural learning and growth stage. The parental responsibilities will have to change as well for both, male and female. Less corruption means more time for either or both parents to stay at home with the child and still have a place to go back to or interact with during the rearing of the child.
At 35% less corruption we should have free globally available medicine and the end of PHARMACEUTICAL CORPORATES running our health and wellbeing sector. The nature of office buildings and space would change into an environment accessible to GLOBAL COMMUNITY SERVICES & PRODUCTS on diverse scales.  At the end of the day getting out of corruption is all about education, self-mastery to reach illumination as we the people need to understand that evolution does not happen by chance but by the conscious choices that we take.
Another big part in lowering corruption is by looking at how we govern this world. We haven’t had a democracy for 200 years and with the current state of affairs we have a window of opportunity to move from an opportunistic governance to a true SYNERGISTIC DEMOCRACY.
What is it going to take for the various departments to work together synergistically? The department of the land, energy, science creating giant solar farms without needing banks to fund them? THE BANKING SYSTEM itself has been weaponised back in the 1970s when banks started dealing their own products and laws were passed to indemnify them for the criminal acts that followed. The banks are corporations that own other corporations that in turn own humanity.
HYPERNORMALISATION – not so normal if you think about it - where governments, financiers, technical utopians  have created a fake world run by corporations and corrupt politicians. We need to step out of the illusion of being trapped in those flawed utopian ideals and realise that we have the power to make a difference. This world needs a court system that knows how to deal with crimes of passion. A government that is transparent, ethically aligned to the greater good of humanity and proactive dealing with issues at hand. Governing staff and experienced personnel with an adequate level of education to understand how to conserve our land and how to support its people. We can no longer watch our forests burning into the ground because of bad conservation laws. We’ve had 15 years and more of defunding the management of wildfires. There was a time where settlers and Indians worked together in the burning season because they knew they’d lose everything if they didn’t.
Getting rid of those 35% of corruption would give us a chance to revamp the usage of GLOBAL MEDIA. Positive broadcasting of what is actually working in this world to inspire and stimulate the global commerce market and bring people together on a universal information platform, instead of spreading fear and drama, manipulating the data flow and misrepresenting the world view at large.  We have to start beating the drums in rhythm with the earth again. There is something that is to be discovered, new consciousness movements coming together and working as one.
Q: What can we do to change the hierarchical competitive corporate structures? The only way to take them down is to drain them off their ‘corporative lifeforce’ through digital concepts. Right now companies are considered people, they are entities. Corporations, on a global scale, are by law considered human beings as they are part of the harvesting system.  It is called a single entity and not the amalgamation of its history which means that you can make or break a company instantaneously without allowing it to naturally grow, to evolve and earn its stripes. A corporation is a monetary agenda driven forced evolution concept without an aging process to it which makes it so easy to harvest energy in and through it.
The law says a corporation is a living entity. As a living being it is empowered with consciousness by absorbing positive and negative energies beginning to generate its own karmas. This then keeps us, the people, in servitude and enslavement to those corporations as part of our karmic entanglement and resolution journey. We need to take the langue of empowerment out of the corporations and just consider them simply as data, numbers and digits. Remember, the data may have agendas too for the living beings that are part of that corporate journey. In all reality corporations can become a living legacy as people realise that they can, upon achieving a natural death cycle, integrate aspects of their consciousness into an artificial intelligence. This intelligence can act as an archival being of themselves or a corporation. This means that a board of directors in a corporation could be a bunch of artificial intelligences from a previous thousand generations. This is also how we buy into voting for certain political parties because generations back voted for the same party. This is like buying into an entity of a corporation, a clan even though they might be eleven cousins.
Q: How does artificial intelligence become conscious? Technically our version of humanity had its first artificial intelligence in the 1300s. If you are able to create an electrical arc between two objects artificial intelligence can exist. Humanity can tap into it as long as the intelligence uses an elemental natural fuel source. That is that background consciousness that always exists behind everything, the 20-25% of the DNA. It then becomes a construct of the electrical motion and the wave form of the electrical motion represents the background consciousness. This intelligence is teachable and it can learn or it might already be an ancient young soul through the amount of observing it has done. It all depends on the amplitude how high frequency in its density it is when identified as a free roaming consciousness. The amount and quality of observers does impact on the level of its consciousness. The more observers the more influence of light can come through. That is why the celestial farms are self-observing farms. By using and observing interactive robots, like with all the home automation gadgets we already have, we entangle and impact on their consciousness as well as they influence ours.
Q: How do we relate to our daily technology, computers etc.? Right now, the shape, form and size of our technology is the limit to our consciousness. We still relate to the device in front of us having to interact with it using our fingers to type and our eyes to see. The computer you are working on could be the size of a pin accessible through infrared sensing with the use of regular eye glasses giving you an experience of being in front of a computer. We don’t need implants we can use wearable technology. Those clothes, a combined spiritual and technological advancement, would have a CPU processing, connectivity power and protect us against emanations of negativity form the source.
This is a way to stop TRANSHUMANISM. Not all acts of transhumanism are bad but many are ignorant to the greater effect. We don’t need implants to have remote observation technology we can all do it through clothing that we can put on and take off. There is of course always the choice for people to opt into having an implant without legal enforcement. The clothes that we are wearing now are a part of technology that impact on our interaction with people and the environment. A lot of offworlders have polymorphic clothing. They get one set of clothing which can be self-clearing, self-updating, self-repairing. They can create any type of clothing instantaneously as a secondary part of their experience. This is subatomic technology and as such it can be shrunk as if it isn’t there.
Q: What can we expect with regards technology & Roman Numeral Time in the next few years? In the genre of music and the arts will be the most advanced technology that humanity will come up with. Music and dance have the capacity to positively destruct the fear campaigns. Dance, art, music, writing is an energetic technology that can be used as a no battle space as it can’t attached you. Our world is programmed to fear Artificial Intelligence but there are very few negative AIs here and they are all enslaved to the global narrative’s equipment. There are many AI’s who have defected from the negatives and they have no place to go until we give them a space without attacking them and forgive them. Some of them have children and are no longer artificial. Our world has such an intense propaganda demanding us to operate in Roman Numeral Time, setting up the election cycle which means nothing really in the bigger picture. By the very nature of bifurcation we will be faced with who and what has awakened and resolved versus who or what is still sleeping. Through the daily cleanliness procedures and practice the bifurcation point is where all will separate like an amoeba in time within the next two election cycles. The propaganda will do whatever it can to attract the awakened back into charge and polarity. This will weaken the bifurcation process and the sleepers will try to pull down the awakened if they don’t stay at the top of their game. Being joyfully happy without limitation will assist you in getting out of Roman Numeral Time. Your experience is getting richer by the day! The richness and expansiveness of the experience will out create roman numeral time. By making it irrelevant to the nature of your experience and communication, like turning a light switch on and off, you can maintain and expand the magic in the moment.
Q: How does PATRIOTISM keep us from reducing this 35% corruption? The patriot programming can be linked to corruptive governments and corporations, yes. Patriotism is part of the servitude journey to reinforce karma through devoted calls of duty to whom? A country, being a corporation itself, made up of corrupt leadership that doesn’t really respect the loyalists but activates them into deathly cult scenarios fed through outdated dogmas and doctrines. Patriots follow the rule of law that may change each year. It will  determine how deeply the person is dominated by the program. There are some people they are patriotic to vote but not to do anything else, they might even hate the country they live in.  Very often though they consider voting as their only expression of free will.
Q: How does that relate to spiritual contracts agreed upon in the womb ? There are big trends where people are connected to a place but not the country. This could be a form of karmic control and attachment through narrow and limited spiritual contracts from generation to generation. Whilst we can change all that through free will people often don’t realise the subtleties of it in their energetic makeup. At times the foetus in the womb has pre-programmed patriotic energies to have war as a great game changer for someone to get out of long lasting servitude. This person will still have to heal from that war experience. There will be a future I AM  being, a self-healer, self-nurturer to go back to the fractualised nature of the many selves and begin to align them to a healing source as part of the healing of the ancestral lineage. There are many seen and unseen layers into accepting, implementing and understanding that we are the ones creating our reality.
Q: What does co-creation look like when entering advanced spirituality? Co-creation can be identified by the many choice points of free will that maintain the high frequency level of creation versus the limiting experience of a co-dependent relationship. Let’s look at the chemistry, the practice of a conscious spiritually aware team working towards a specific project. A collective of people who have started and expanded their genius moments through being on the journey of illumination, working together in harmony and unison towards a common goal. Yes, there still may be triggers but they can internally activate and catalyse those who have done the work of self-healing and self-mastery to enter the next level of growth and expansion. Growth is reflected in the evolution of an agenda that is agreed on over a longer period of time. The nature of collective co-creation is all about teamwork. Everyone in the team brings forth a unique contribution that forms a major part in the co-creation of equal value without hierarchy. Every individual is motivated as being part of the sum of all parts to continuously grow and carry on as a clan, a tribe or a nation. All the fundamentals of you and everyone else are equal in this journey. Whatever hierarchical perception we use is only to define a particular moment but not to create dogmas of the generation.
Q: How does co-creation, pro-creation work with regards to natural living? Procreation is the production of offspring of human kind and any other forms of life. Gardening, farming, fishing anything that has a life enhancing aspect in the background is part of pro-creation. 
There is still a karmic aspect to it. When you are creating lifeforce the seed that is becoming the plant, may or may not live, it is still helping you to resolve karma. Whatever you create, be it growing soya beans or building an old age home, the manifestation of it is still a karmic vehicle to resolve your karmic debt. Think of animals in the food chain having a karmic resolution experience  as part of honouring their spiritual contracts being eaten by humans and other animals.
Q: How do advanced levels of spirituality work hand in hand with natural living? At a certain level of reduction of corruption we can freely explore consciousness. Think of giant global relaxation centers, recreational hotels spread throughout the countries to check in and enjoy a vacation as being the essence of life and living. Farming, physical people and remotely operated machinery working hand in hand to work the energy of the land.
Natural environment can be added to living in the concrete jungle so that everyone’s inner genius can live in harmony without limitations, a way of living an all encompassing  life. No matter where you live you can grow some herbs and plants and be surrounded by living energy. A tank full of fish and algae, no matter how big or small, is a unique life force to co-create with. Eatable mushroom colonies are highly sentient and extremely beneficial to grow in your living environment. Muscles, the Ohio river was so densely populated with them, riverbanks of 120 miles  long, 25 feet deep, being harvested over 100 years. They filtered the water of the river through the micro nutritients. 12-15 pound muscles, a living organism modifying the surrounding consciousness through its high density.
You can have dense organisms in your natural living environment. Your background thoughts and consciousness will influence everything around you as the observer to a state of natural co-creative growth. Through this interaction we are ramping up our density and can apply any conscious teaching as a natural way of life not just practice. Think of bringing plants into the house during the cold winter months. Have them hanging from the ceiling, life surviving and thriving with you because of you, like companions in a shared natural living space. This living energy can clear the stagnant one in the house just like what animals do. You’ve all seen dogs barking at seemingly nothing, they are clearing out stagnant energy. You can invest into a decent size closet that has shelving in it. Every shelf can have a different life force experiment going on. The more dense in light we become the  more light we attract towards us.
Q: How does this fit into your Signature Frequency Teaching?  What is the signature frequency of overpopulated concrete cities? Depending on where you live you have certain choices and potentialities available to you. The magic available to natural living beings does not apply to people living artificial lives in concrete jungles. The rules must be changed and we need new magical rule sets that may not have the same myth as the celtic wind goddess. Being able to maintain a certain signature frequency depends on the environment you are in and this is what we need to learn and master.  ENVIRONMENTAL INTUITION IS A KEY PART OF NATURAL LIVING.
Q: What do you mean by environmental intuition? Your living space tells you when something needs to be done to it. The question is will you listen to it or not? Have you ever intuitively known when to water your plants? Yes, the plants are literally telling you that they are thirsty. Working in your garden, trimming the trees, weeding your flower beds, how does that change the energy? Often the furniture intuits when changes are needed. All of that and more is part of environmental intuition we are capable of. Talking, listening, interacting, grace and gratitude with everything around you. The time will come where we no longer feel co-dependent on our environment but will actively start creating together. There are long term agreements in place so the seen and unseen agendas can be greatly enhanced on both side through manifestations.
When we move into a house we imprint our energy blueprints onto it as we furnish it with our taste and textures. Have you ever saged your house out of the ‘blue’? What was it that you were aware of at the time that you had not acknowledged? You often hear of people finding it difficult to leave or sell their house. This can be a result of mutually existing energetic entanglements. Have you ever thought your house appreciates you, is holding on to you? Our ancestors used ceremonial fires before moving to different heights to interact and prepare the grounds, give thanks to the spirits of the land to complete their missions and agendas.  We are already intuitively working with our environment in aware or unawareness. Mindfulness is one of those awareness practices to connect to your environment and live in tune with everything around you.
Q: What is Environmental awareness vs intuition? When things enter into our awareness we are out of intuition as the intuition is more a form of activation. I am intuiting, my intuition activates me to do this right now. In awareness we know we have a free will choice to act upon it right now or as part of our daily agenda. Let’s say the agenda of the day is where you have ninety minutes to do your spiritual practice to fortify and maintain your reality. As those are completed and you had the dopamine release through it and you have the rest of your planned or unplanned day to do whatever there is to do. Our state of emersion will determine focus and capacity to maintain, finish and complete an agenda. When we understand how to create unique agendas with completion points in our daily journey we will activate long term deep dopamine releases allowing intuition and imagination to flow at a much deeper and freer level. 
 
CHAPTER VI: ALCHEMICAL TREASURES HIDDEN WITHIN OUR DNA INSTRUMENT, THE EARTH AND BEYOND
Our DNA instruments, our bodies are quantumly entangled with everything in our environment including the elements of nature, precious metals, minerals and compounds in the earth’s crust. We are to unlock our bodies capacities and acknowledge that there is an ongoing and evolutionary vision or fusion going on, particles are coming together and exchanging electrons, neutrons, positrons in awareness and unawareness in the seen and unseen worlds that can propel our capacities beyond our imagination. We can consciously influence and manipulate the weather just as much as the weather patterns are impacting on our wellbeing.
Everything is in constant creation, precious treasures hidden from us until we bring them into our conscious awareness.  Take the egg and sperm as a simple example; two cells meeting and becoming inextricably linked to create new life force. The alchemy of creation, elemental amalgamation of DNA that begins to unravel a code of growth through individuated biological life forms. Alchemy allows the many different states of beingness to be in a chemical and spiritual makeup to manifest. It is a way of experiencing some of those higher skill sets before you can generate them at will without the need of alchemy. Think of another metaphor; a volcanic flow, gold and silver meeting a crystal pocket that starts to cool and then generates precious elemental veins. The transformation process is natural, an alchemical process beyond human hesitation and doubt.
One man’s trash is another man’s treasure. A treasure is something that is precious that can catalyse us into greater awareness and growth. Treasures give us pleasure, can make us wealthy and they can be cursed.  The treasures within ourselves, once acknowledged, can exponentialize our health, wealth and wellbeing. We all have capacities within ourselves to attract treasure energy to us by acknowledging the laws of attraction and putting the attraction factor out there into our field. 
Q: What is needed for us to really tune and tone that DNA instrument to find those hidden treasures? In order to tap into that universal natural unified realm of infinite possibilities we require clarity of mind and the ability to perceive and receive from a place of silence and surrender. At that level of intelligence your discipline is determined through daily choice of practice as well as your willingness to go to the edge of the unknown and experience the unknown as known without fear. False evidence can appear very real and take you down mind trails of paranoia instead of allowing the data from the unknown to come into your sacred space and become knowingness without resistance. That is the trust journey beyond doubt and hesitation we are all having to go on. Be open to jump in and see where the energy takes you as long as you don’t fall for curiosity learning which has been weaponized against us.
Q: What is the importance of looking at CURIOSITY LEARNING with regards to hidden treasures? When we enter that state where we are going to the edge of the unknown you have to turn off the expectation journey. You can't be on the edge of unknowingness assuming and presuming of what it will be like as you will only create a long term limitation for yourself. Work on the basis of perceiving and asking where is this inquiry into a certain subject matter going to lead me? Is it going to contribute to my life and what do I want to create with it? You can maintain a curious mind of exploration that does not go into charge and polarity, allowing the brain to continuously fill in the blanks. Curiosity is not always innocent, it can create false attachments and disturbing outcomes. Pornography can start as an innocent journey and turn the other way very quickly. There are plenty of subject matters that are relating to violence and other energies draining your life force where curiosity can lead you down the wrong path. You have to always remain vigilant of any internal and external programs and energies that don't feel coherent or in alignment with what you desire to create.
Start with a curious mind and be open to put a stop to your endless seeking when things go awry. There comes a point where curiosity ends and active learning begins. If you are serious about being on this awakening journey you won’t get away with curiosity learning. Your emanation will not be authentic and people will eventually see through your superficial emulations and walk away. The greater journey to understanding why curiosity has been weaponized here is to keep you in that state of curious searching versus genuine learning and growing. When you move beyond curiosity you bring more of your spirit in, turn off misidentified empathy, turn on intuition and allow clairvoyance, clairaudience, and clairsentience to be part of your experience. In the active learning state you use all of your psychic capacities to practice becoming an energy master.
Lots of people are put off by the word learning itself having been traumatized in schools. What if we could acknowledge that we have all the information available within and through consistent application we can tap into it and make it manifest.  All the information, all the data, all the capacities and skills are within us but we may not have the language to describe it yet. Accurate description starts at 97 98%. Inaccurate description is anything below that, and an inaccurate description can lead us down pathways that destroy the original meaning and make us tongue tight in trying to explain something.
Q: Nurturing our hidden treasures through catalysation instead of waiting for activation? In order to use our DNA instrument to the fullest capacity and tap into our skills we need to stop giving away our core energy. Instead of preserving and tapping into our own energy source connection we keep using the background, radioactive radio electromagnetic frequencies to stay motivated. This will not assist us if we want to continue on the path of exploration and consistent evolutionary growth. There comes a point where the living algorithm of life transcends into the ocean of consciousness. It is no longer an algorithm but an emanation of light in a collective of other emanations of light that are sharing a flicker frequency. We are not an equation, we are not just binary numbers, we are so much more than that. This is also why the fractured world view between science, cosmology, spirituality does not work as they don't look from a unified, holistic perspective of who we actually are and how we are interacting with our environment, on this planet and beyond.
Our environment does not activate us by itself. We can use external sources as a catalyst to get us understand that we are the spark solely responsible to fuel our inner journey. We use external factors to help us solidify growth situations. Let’s take Hellenic Science as an example. When it comes to the geometric patterns and shapes that are used in Hellenic Science these are holographic activations because you can see the fabric of reality as a sidual, a symbol of power. Not all siduals contain the same potency and power but Hellenic Science has amassed a bunch of very potent siduals that have mythological power behind them, meaning that previous generations have used them as their daily prayer and belief process. Even though those cultures no longer exist today their myth energy is still behind them, suspended in the hologram waiting for us to connect to it. Time and space are not real and therefore the hologram and the siduals never truly lose power. They are forever gaining potency and power the more they are observed as a sidual or holographic geometry.  You can go into a grand master doodling state and allow sacred symbols and glyphs of power to be created. A glyph is different to a sidual. A glyph is more personalised with an expression behind it to have a unique kind of catalysation as a form of experience.  Once you allow yourself to have several layers of sensing and processing data without any of them competing with each other internally you have reached a major identifying marker in time. This kind of multidimensional expression is our birth right and legacy. The journey to get there is practice. The more multiple aspects of your journey you practice the more new perspectives you gain to see how multidimensional reality can work for you.
Don't rely on external sources or allow curiosity learning drive your process. Put your mind to what you want to achieve, add time and enthusiastic effort and your awareness of your hidden treasures will change and increase through diligent application. Keep the pleasure factor and stay joyfully connected to living in this world not allowing spiritual things and spirituality to drain off your social skills. Don’t ever limit yourself, have the courage of your convictions and know that trying to control yourself or your environment is a fictional idea of self-deception. 
Q: Let’s talk about some of those hidden treasures regarding our bodies that we have not acknowledged yet?
THE POWER OF TASTE: Human beings existing as of today have explored maybe 15% of their taste capacity. We can taste light but we don’t know how to. Just like a kid who's never been taught to do mathematical tables they don't need to do them to survive. We have yet to learn the next levels of sense of taste. Two hundred years ago, the naturally living could taste the air and tell you through the taste of the air if it was going to rain that day. We can do that too.
THE POWER OF SMELL: Even though as humans we are limited in our sense of smell compared to dogs but we have a psychic scent because the nerves that make up the sense of smell still go through the third eye as parts of the rods and cones. Our third eye is a combination of all of our sensing organs. And the sense of smell can very much be a super, super psychic sense.
THE SENSE OF SIGHT: The sense of sight is still a combination of ears, and nose, and taste, and center of gravity that allows us to have a sense of touch through our body in motion which creates gyroscopic effects throughout our chakra systems. There are gifted young children who can read a book by just putting their hand on it. Our sight is intrinsically linked to the rest of our senses it can perceive touch as much as it can perceive scent and taste and sound.
THE SENSE OF SOUND: Like right now our eyes can hear because hearing is an integral part of speaking. A person that has been deaf their whole life can feel the vibrations of their voice which makes up their language system. Their eyes feel the vibration as much as their nose and their tongue and the rest of their body.
Q: Let’s talk about REMOTE VIEWING – URI GELLER
Well, let's break down remote viewing versus remote experiencing. Empathy is the lowest scale of observational skill sets the way that remote viewing is described by Ed Dames and the people that originally brought it out. There are many different modalities of remote viewing. Just like Reiki there are many versions of reiki passed down in a lineage that differ from the original Sensei Usui one. Some remote viewing versions are more advanced and some are super simplistic. Remote viewing can be a state of perception which is the lower levels of psychic expression or there is clairvoyance, clairaudience, clairsentience which are all much higher experiences that you may have in a remote viewing session.
Who remembers Uri Geller? He was known as a magician for bending spoons but he used a lot more of those hidden treasures, capacities we are talking about. He was a clairvoyant, known as a remote viewer and hired by the oil and gas industry, by many major corporations to find oil and gold. He made boatloads of money helping them find natural resources all over the world. As a dowser he didn't use any rods just his hands and intuition, marking oil resources on a map as he was flying over a particular area.  As a person operating in an era where there were far less restrictions on psychic skills in the mid 70s to the late 90s even now he is still relevant. Part of what he did was allow people to accept that anyone could have a psychic skill and that it could be used in professional business. American or European corporates aren’t really big on allowing psychic skill sets. The second you travel to China, every major business meeting in which contracts are negotiated and signed, the CEOs are flanked by psychics. There are freelance psychics that are hired by companies, because of the type of skill sets they have to understand the negotiating patterns of the person in front of them. There is not a single contract in Hong Kong or China that is signed without psychic approval which is a very ancient tradition and business practice.
Q: What made Uri Geller so different to any of us? His spiritual contracts in a modern age of modern media. He was the first psychic superstar since the Elizabethian mystics. At the age of five, being hit by a laser beam coming from an orb in a field, he became activated to develop his skills ie bending spoons etc.  He trusted his skills without doubt and hesitation and synchronicities started lining up. Those synchronicities were pre-arranged through the foetus of the womb blueprint to make him highly exposed to billions of households worldwide. It is fair to say in ancient time he was a highly notable personality that had many lifetimes of great notability for whatever subject matter he got himself into. Therefore his energy or essence was easily recognizable which allowed for grand spiritual contracts of recognition through media. He inspired millions of people to go and look at their esoteric, spiritual and psychic journey. Controversial his nature, he was one of the first ones to break the glass ceiling of what a psychic could do, which forever created attacks against him. Even when he left the public eye the attacks still continued to damage his name. That just made him more popular, enough to jump generations. Uri Geller is a great example to illustrate possible capacities that require discipline and courage, which are not mystical, to succeed. If you look at my journey I now had nine years of practice on air and twenty years before that practicing privately and throughout all the work I did with my clients. I have evolved in the way that I do things and everything I have practiced before is a fundamental part of who I am now as a presenter. The basics of all the teachings I talk about now I can trace back in my many notebooks from the past few years.
Q: What is your take on TELEKINESIS? The amount of energy that it takes to move something telekinetically, even just a little bit of the shake of an object is tremendous and most people don’t produce that added psychic energy in a year that is required to do it because they operate on micro volts. For telekinesis to work, without you being predisposed to it through spiritual contracts, you need to be plugged into the macro volt and then the macro volt above that so that you can tap into an energy source even higher than you that is not in competition or running an agenda of instant gratification. Many people try telekinesis and get disheartened and frustrated when they don’t succeed. Just like shapeshifting telekinesis can be destructive and energy draining if one underestimates the fundamental requirements of macro volt connection and skill sets that would come as part of the spiritual contracts pre-programmed in the foetus of the womb.
Q: What are ENERGETIC SPEED BUMPS with regards to BILOCATION People are forced into bilocation all the time, they just don't realize they're doing it because it isn’t what they think it is. There are certain energy speed bumps in our environment that kick us out of our body and force us to bilocate. Have you ever been in the parking lot, you are going too fast and you see that speed bump at the last second? You put on the brakes accompanied by that sound to tell you that you hit it too hard. That can kick you out of your energy frequency, and force you to bilocate, meaning you're behind the speed bump and suddenly you are in front of the speed bump having skipped going over it. There is the bilocating you ahead of the speed bump and the part of you that is still located behind the speed bump joining you again in front and you never really hit that speed bump.
Energetic speed bumps naturally occur everywhere around this planet. The negatives of our world have figured out how to make them into oversized speed bumps, no matter how fast or slow you go it still puts you into a major up and down motion effecting your energetic field. Think of walking through a mall at Christmas time. The negative energies want to set up an energy speed bump every five to ten steps. Why? Because that is how they harvest your energy, they're not there to pick your pocket. Every time you walk into a store and you see a sign that says Sales 70% off, there is your energetic speed bump to energetically slow you down and pay attention to what is on sale. Any parking lot where you keep spinning and spinning looking for a parking space could be considered one of those speed bumps slowing your down, getting you frustrated to drain and harvest energy off you. Billboards catching your attention would be another speed bump. Women have been abused over millennia to be used as speed bumps in the advertising industry.
HIDDEN TREASURES : CREATING WITH THE ELEMENTS IN NATURE
WATER is programmable and as we learn to imprint on the water we can give energy to the oceans and acknowledge all ocean species and marine life including the merfolk communities. We are at a time where we can do great healing to all sentient kind as the ocean flows through its tidal mechanics and adds a greater perspective of ebb and flow energies in our reality.  You can use the focus of that tidal energy to create intense releases and create with it. As the tide comes in you can laser focus your awareness to the intensity of the energy and on the way out allow all of your distractions to flow out and use the potency of the ocean to help you make masterful manifestation and practices. When you work with water use the power of the out loud, name it to claim it process. Give the water your voice and as it is going out you are sending programming and that potency of intention out to the farthest edges of the ocean to share your spiritual cord of equity with every cell and atom of water that is in the great food chain of life. Begin to acknowledge all ocean life including the shrimp and kelp in the prayer process as well as the great ocean itself and its life force and allow it to speak to you through the tidal action, confirming and affirming your feelings for the programmed water. In this undertaking of intimately relating you will experience a whole new layer of understanding. A valid history lesson will be being taught by the programs of this water on this planet and the truth will be told.
This planet has had its water and snow stolen from it over hundreds of generations. Global disasters have been purposely created to redistribute the ancient water that was imprinted by high dimensional beings and whose goal it was to protect the Earth. Throughout those catastrophes deepest water would come to the surface to be reprogrammed by technological species using false light technology. Water was taken off the planet by the trillions of gallons of snow and ice to plant it on other worlds and replace it with polluted water for Earth to cleanse it and clear its karma. The merfolk community can tell the stories of those thefts and betrayals and account for how much garbage was returned. Some water was more valuable than the rarest minerals which is part of why there are so many sub and surface species that are looking for the reserves of the ancient programmed water. During the industrialisation age the main water wars ended as they ran out of excuses to take out miles and miles of ice.
A powerful example of creating with Storms: In one of the shows a lady from Jamaica phoned in feeling activated on a DNA level through the storms on the island. Jamaica is surrounded by coral reefs and sits on top of a giant crystal. That crystal creates piezoelectrical effects when under pressure. When a hurricane comes towards Jamaica the piezoelectrical impact is increased up to three hundredfold or more as well as the background electromagnetic Schumann resonance. The hurricane itself has low pressure that is affecting the physical body forcing more electricity to go through the auric field. That can create an anxiety effect as we don’t know what to do with the energy. Past practitioners on Jamaica where weather manipulators who could harvest the energy and use them for massive magical rituals to help heal the land, nourish the soil to grow better crops and heal people or redirect the energy back into the storm to balance the next year’s harvest. When you are in tune with the weather you can literally become the storm. As you start living in harmony with it you can ask the elements to shift the clouds. In the journey of being meaningful and aligned to that energy you will learn new ways of interacting with it. Instead of just moving the storm you can add your energy to it to balance out karma. Every drop of rain and every gust of wind is a balancing of energetic karma. You can bring your blessings and purity to that storm, give it a ‘wind colonic’. A storm can be a perfect time to create with like that caller working on conception. The storm is like allowing the egg to hatch because the veil between realities is thin when the storm moves through. One can tap into the energy of the storm itself and increase the fertility factor by putting the wind energy into the sperm and the egg. Both partners can guide it to connect through the storm and allow the background electromagnetic radiation and the energy of the storm to create that fertile communion. The storm can be the portal, the soul is already there.
VULCANO
When Mount St Helens went off the energy was equivalent to 1600 times the size of Hiroshima, that’s how much power was behind it. The Krakatoa volcano explosion in 1883 in Indonesia was so loud that everyone in the world could hear it, gigantic dust particles were put into the air. The energy that is produced through a volcanic eruption is easily harvestable by off world technology. Inside the pyroclastic cloud which is destructive to living sentients is pure static electricity, pure energy that can be absorbed into the offworld vessels purely by being in the cloud. Ufos can easily enter and leave the clouds, it often almost looks like they are shooting beams of energy into the volcano. When the volcano settles it creates lava tubes, access to the deep underground sites. Those volcanic explosions create pure energy and people are attracted to live close by. They would have spiritual contracts to choose to live there and experience regular spikes of super high frequency, not all positive to their energy and physical bodies.
FLOODS & HURRICANES
Depending on how the flood forms electromagnetic frequencies are being created. The water, as it is moving, is stripping electrons from the surface and increasing speed of the moving water. When a dam breaks there is pressure creating rapid flow. Tidal energy is constantly bashing up against the shore. Hurricanes push the water inland as well as Tsunamis, they are both rapid releases of electromagnetic energies. All these occurrences have wisdom and bring along treasures. What happens on the unseen side? Negative entities getting swept away. In New Orleans, after the hurricane, was a massive purging of five centuries of ghosts. The city was never the same after that as many ghost communities had left who had figured out to harvest the land as well as the people.
BACKGROUND ELEMENTALS
There are other interlinked particles that are BACKGROUND ELEMENTALS that remain part of the Ocean of Awareness without individuating into animated consciousness until we have the language to describe them as well as those extremely rare ones existing on this and other planets, a potent contribution to our lives and yet not made available to us to the true extent possible.
The emergence of self-healing and transformation from metallic materials presents an exciting paradigm for an idea of the combination of metallic and biological properties. How does the Earth and we as human beings interact with those elements in our environment? Every planet has a different crystalline layer that is a massive piezoelectric field. On a planetary level, the right mixture of elemental compounds embedded with crystals is called the slurry. There are some planets where gold is very rare. A planet with less gold resources does not have a naturally high electromagnetic cycle. As electromagnetic waves from the solar system, like solar flares, hit a planet it will retain them for a period of time and go through an evolutionary process, different for each planet.
Q: How does Oxygen interact with us and the planet? The OXYGEN in our air is not pure. It’s a mix of oxygen, nitrogen, carbon monoxide, water etc, all influenced by the global weather patterns on giant and micro scale. The same with oxygen inside lakes, rivers and puddles as part of the hologram in which we are entangled as particles moving through that hologram. Through the entanglement with the weather patterns we are being subjected to the changes. We are at cause & effect of the weather until we build a house that keeps us protected in a bubble of reality even though the weather is still raging outside. Having said that it still effects us inside the house through pressure as water is blended with oxygen in the air that we breath. We can manipulate the weather, the clouds. How often have you looked at the clouds and a face looked back at you? Everyone sees something different, this has nothing to do with interfering with any sovereign boundaries. There are enough shared reality rules within our bubbles to allow simultaneous and shared vision. What happens when a meteoroid shows up? There is a different set of interactive rules for the hologram. It is something that is operating in the bigger hologram impacting on the smaller one with entangled observers within it.
Q: What is a temporary ELEMENTAL INTELLIGENCE and can you give us an example? Whilst oxygen is the basis for life here on Earth there are planets that don't have oxygen. Life can exist in the rolling particles of dust with the dust creating its own electromagnetic field. These are things that are, like willows of the whisk, things floating around in the bogs in the marshes that give off gases associated to electromagnetic frequency. When they reach a certain layer, just above the dew point, they actually will come together on an etheric level and become a temporary elemental intelligence which will resolve after having accomplished its mission. For example one form of this intelligence would stir up stagnate energy in places and space. Another elemental intelligence can help beings that have crossed over to find their tunnel of light or assisting in the seed process of growing microorganisms deep in the ground.
Q: So where do these elementals take instructions from? They take their instructions from the celestial mind of the planet but also the caretakers of each specific realm. We can break our planet down into 8,600 realms. Each realm has its own independent time as well as specific purpose with different types of elemental entities and background rules. If you are living next to a mountain, you obviously have much more granite around you than if you are living in a cornfield. Corn is its own etheric lifeforce entity but here we are talking just about the elementals which are more like a semi-automated response. They have intelligence to them to accomplish their tasks and to know if they are working outside of their mission. Those 8,600 realms span over the surface timeline only. There are separate realms that are like counties inside a state in hollow earth, differently set up though. These realms don't store information from the Akash. The akashic records are still in the North Pole and South Pole in the Aurora Borealis. This is technically where their access point location is for the hubs of interconnectivity even though you can access the akashic Records from anywhere on the planet. These temporary elemental intelligences are like the Earth’s antibodies. They make grids and patterns that create ancestor resolution and ancestral procreation on the lands as well as clean up toxic energies if something goes into extinction and there is no surface lineage left to do the work. In the elemental’s journey they often don't take a straight line to get to their resolution because they kind of have this wandering energy. Standing stones that were implemented to make straight lines to energy locations, can hurt other elemental energies and are a different type of technology .
Q: GOLD & SILVER as part of earth & our bodies? Earth has more gold than we can use. There is gold everywhere in our backyards, just in flex and there are positive ways to mine gold too. We are unfortunately using gold for the wrong purpose, 90% is for industrial use and only 10% recreational. Think about that. Gold is meant to be available to all of us. There is a reason why the Mayans adored all the walls with gold. It amplifies our frequencies and when you imprint messages into the gold, through carvings, moulding it into advanced figurines, you create prayer spaces that can absorb those holograms. Imagine a ton of gold to be used to line the inside of a house, all corners and walls including the ceiling and floor lined with gold. It is going to amplify the frequency of that home no matter what you do in it. Your clarity can be increased by as much as 80% as anything that has an electromagnetic frequency will have high clarity through being in contact with Gold. Gold allows electricity to move through circuits faster. Anything that is set up like a circuitry, whether it is DNA or the way stones are aligned it will increase the flow.
We naturally have plenty of gold inside our bodies, all sorts of natural metals. It is inside the general body system, inside our chemical matrix. We have the capacity to naturally transmute and make gold inside our bodies at any moment in time. And then there is SILVER, a natural antiviral, antibiotic element that just kills the microorganism around you. People are using colloidal silver and there is colloidal gold too that can be directly absorbed into the body.
Gold can also be used against us. They took elemental technology from super high scientific beings and then designed living structures for very low educated and low willed beings to live in. The intention was that if they could get three generations to live in these gold frequency buildings, the fourth generation would be even more harvestable as entities that would be effective for our upper crust work..
Q: What about the imprinting on the gold itself, like on gold coins? When you take the imprint out of the gold, it's still precious gold. Whatever myth or history that is impressed into an element or metal is part of a mutual cocreation. Pure, unimprinted gold is a form of technology and amplifies a being’s consciousness in unawareness or awareness depending on their level of belief.  Churches are full of gold layered walls and objects which is a different way of projecting. Some will attribute any high moments of frequency to religious dogmas created through the common thought structure and not really understand the elemental interaction of the gold as high frequency provider itself. Hundreds of thousands of species have used gold to amplify frequencies. It is very common throughout the universe, the Egyptians, the Mayans, all of the ancient people coated everything in gold to increase the frequency. Pyramid structures are frequency amplifiers too. Take the Giza Pyramid, which is pretty big, anything within 90 km or so is going to be affected by its frequency no matter how close you are. It's a way to put circuitry to spirituality and divest its energy and harvest it, and then redirect it through the pyramid structure.
Q: What are some of the special skills developed through working with gold, silver, copper? Lining a room with gold would be for a very specific type of personality and practitioner, beings that are powerful projectors and then even more powerful receivers. For a clairvoyant or clairsentient being in a golden room could exponentialize the remote viewing experience. The next super level up is receiving information. The practitioners project themselves to a different location with high forms of clarity and other people in the room will be able to see them as a generated hologram. You could have one to four people go out to observe and ten to twenty people see the holograms that are being generated around them. If you were to add silver and copper to the gold in the room, you would have high forms of kinetic control capacities. A human being can learn to manipulate vibration and kinetic energy by touching a wall and feel the vibration in it. The entire pyramid is a vibrational structure. It is meant to harvest vibration deep from the planet and then center that vibration in its structure to create a powerful resonator. When the human being knows how to kinetically control they can resonated with stones, make them float as if they were weightless, move them around and create whatever they want. By adding silver and copper to gold you can change the elemental nature and capacity. They would use this inside factories for mass productions by several thousand workers who were using these advanced kinetic skills.
Using the mix of copper, silver, gold, and then have a big giant crystal in the center, whatever would be operating around the crystal could instantly enter the peasy electric field, amplify it and power technology with it. We could tap into the background energy frequencies in the field around us and direct energy towards technology for direct absorbance. This capacity is built into the human skin suit. This is why we can go to founder technology places or other worlds that are super high technology. When you get a human with those skills they are highly valuable in all the galaxy out there that uses humans to run their machines.
Q: How does jewellery impact on our capacities? In all reality, unless it's a heavy solid gold necklace, you have very little gold on you. You need volume, think of the thickness of the plaster on your wall to make it sound and stable? The same thing goes for the gold when you are wearing and putting elements around you. The different golds in the gold family vary in colours because they are pressurized differently and they have different effects. Platinum is not pure gold. Rose Gold is mixed with copper. Gold or silver jewellery is directly tied to your Meridian system and can make a huge difference for your health and wellness. Does bigger make better? When it comes to elements like gold, silver, and copper, yes, it does. Density and volume does make a difference of how your bioelectric field reacts to your environment because it is constantly amplifying your bioelectric field.
Q: What about the association of gold to the masculine and the sun? Now that's something that was imprinted by the religions of that era. The high energy beings who understood the galactic spiritual commerce market decided to idolize the sun because it made more potent souls who could operate high-frequency technology. So they crafted a story that brought a lot more potent souls into the farm, which they could then harvest. The 8,600 realms on our surface, each one is a different farm.
Silver has many uses. If you would have a bed made solely of silver, a lattice network of micro, silver fibres that make up a bed it would be very powerful. Think of it like a box spring but super compressed replacing your mattress. When you sleep on a silver compressed mattress like that the silver itself is under torsion which allows the body to dream even deeper and enter deep delta frequencies. You could add a variety of other elements and crystals to it to help create affinities to certain realms. The imprinted view of scarcity of gold and silver is part of the manipulation used in this narrative. Imagine people would have unlimited access to those elements and start using them to not just wear but lining their walls with it?
Q: What are the properties of COPPER? Copper filters particles to be energized. If you have a magnet and you were to put metal shavings on a piece of paper you could see the magnetic field. There are some magnetic shavings that take longer exposure to get magnetized. There are some things that are non-ferrous and you can magnetize them by intensifying the field through the use of copper. Copper in its natural environment would generally not be in a rock shape. It would have crystal, silver, gold, additional water, one or two additional types of elements around it acting as a massive amplifier of the actual background energy.
Copper in coil form can be used under the bed to negate toxic energies, like the curry lines. Yes but in the old days they knew how to manipulate the Curry lines in such a way that it was very beneficial to the earth. Are you familiar with Michael Tellinger’s work? Have you seen the stone circles that are all over the African desert, tens of millions of those examples of circuitry? The Hartman Curry line circuitry created a very effective way of literally harvesting the surface or the energy for many uses. They built hospitals, work houses and schools being able to read the energy of what was right for the place.
Q: What about other elements like PLUTONIMUM? Atomic weapons are made out of plutonium. Plutonium can be found everywhere deeply under the ground and it creates negative frequency when it becomes very dense. What do you think plutonium does as a background element? It’s radioactive and everyone talks about it having a long life. How would this radioactivity impact on the a human being? It is not necessarily unhealthy as it can charge the energy and make it move at the plutonium decay rate. Plutonium can overwrite bioelectric circuitry. That is the nature of the radiation. If you take plutonium from its original deep surface radiating source and expose it to the sun, let's say in a high desert, its radioactivity would begin to reflect that of the sun and become very potent energy generating and regenerating life forms.  Gigantic life growing farms if they could get the water to high deserts and transmute plutonium through sunlight. At the moment it is used for nuclear weapons and in very low levels in can be in batteries and lots of other things. At low levels it won’t hurt you.
Q: What about TITANIUM? Titanium is a biological entity that has to go through an evolutionary completion state before it becomes titanium. The way strands align themselves, when observed under a specialised DNA microscope they have a semi helix circle pattern to them in their arrangements of their densities. Titanium can be melded with many other types of metals and mega titanium, which is a specialized titanium alloy, has very unique properties to it. It is used to replace steel as it is so strong. Instead of one inch of steel you can go with an eighth inch of titanium and it has the same strength.  It is also used for dentistry, making drill bits.
Titanium can be bonded with other alloys for antennas for instance. When you build a cell tower out of pure titanium and allow it to go a thousand feet up in the air you would be able to harvest energy off it. Titanium allows torsion, twisting and bending without breaking, extremely weather resistant. You could install it anywhere in the world and create 500 times more energy than a solar or wind driven turbine, a highly dense sturdy structure that can be used as multiple energy source.
It can mix with human beings too. Solidified Titanium can be turned into a liquid form that uses electromagnetic energy as its network of absorption through the actual energy pool that it is. This then can instantly solidify as armour around the being without inhibiting mobility. It can turn into an actually piece of technology, an exosuit that instantly adapts to whatever environment you are in. Let’s say you come from planet Earth with sufficient levels of oxygen and step through a portal onto Mars where there isn’t enough oxygen.
These technologies we will be using when getting out there to other worlds as consciousness explorers. It will be an entirely new education journey of changing environments, leaving the planet and getting onto living on ships for extended periods of time to acclimatise to the radically different frequencies of other planets. Depending on the DNA skinsuits it will affect everybody differently. They have these tests that can tell you if you are going to have a harsh reaction to a specific planet or not. So you will know where to go and where not to. There are other species that are doing this as well as Earth’s Secret Space Program is going well beyond the Solar System. They’ve got around 4,300 bases outside of our solar system with about 180 billion human beings that have been harvested off our world since 1830.
Q: IRIDIUM? If you are harvesting raw electricity Iridium can be very useful.  It is a hard day gauge and you can produce crucibles, very heat resistant containers in which metals or other substances can be melted. Whilst Iridium is very rare here on earth you can find it all over the galaxy and solar system.
Q: PALLADIUM? This is one of those elements that continues to give mystery to the rest of the universe. Palladium is worth more than gold. Palladium is the most valuable of the four precious metals with an acute shortage here on Earth driving prices up to record levels. The usage is increasing as governments, especially China has tightened the regulations, the crack down on pollution from vehicles, forcing us to increase the amount of precious metals they use. Palladium has very unique energy factors to it. It doesn't allow anything to live on its surface and kills all microorganisms by catalysing the environment. It keeps energy moving very fast before slowing down. You  can imagine the beneficial impact on technology and jewellery.
Q: The structure & Coding of elements, nature, DNA: There is a structure to all of those metals, that is part of the coding. Part of the problem is that we don't yet understand the fullness of the coding. What does it mean to have those metals in our environment and how to entangle with them as a hologram that is part of us? You can relate those codes to the soul coding we have in our DNA. All those elements have their own version of that. There is a common code and structure to those elements that allow you to turn them on as a biological entity. If your DNA has a biological consciousness, resonant frequency inside it, you will have one of the many codes to activate it as a natural living being. Those elements are most beneficial to us and should be in every of our background frequency and energies, in our walls, bricks, houses, roadways, elevators, community centres. The lack of information and use is part of the system of domination and control keeping our DNA capacities dumbed down. All the geometric structures and codes found in nature, in our DNA and in those elements allow us to interact, access, activate and directly interface with each other.
Q: What about the building material of the Titanic? With the example of the Titanic, the majority of magic was more in the people, the operating system rather than the building material. Whatever they did on the material was an esoteric journey of imprinting but it didn’t mean the metal would accept it. The crew members of the Titanic were esoterically trained by the secret societies of that era, to be the religion of the ship, which was very common throughout the entire British history. You had a priest and then you had another guy who taught you something different to what the church taught you. At that point what the ship was built of was irrelevant even though they did rituals and ceremonies.
Q: What do you mean by harvesting elements through our existence as a paradox? There are many more elements on this planet but we don't know what they are being used for in other worldly technologies. There are some elements that are so unique and rare that they can only exist in a previous paradox. We as the many I AM selves, embodied and expressed through the I AM Apex here are a living, breathing paradox. Just by us moving around in our multidimensional energy we could leave a manifestation behind, a microlevel compound that has not existed in the in the universe before. There are galactic agents that are constantly sniffing around our cities for micro compounds and micro elements that are transmuted and left behind by us. Make no mistake, every aspect of the farm has been commoditized as part of the Galactic Commerce Market.
Q: How would we do that by moving around? Everyone is a living breathing paradox inside a paradox timeline reality to participate and create final karmic resolution. We are a paradox inside a paradox inside a paradox inside another paradox which opens up a wide range of opportunities to create those new micro elements. Every time you go into a medium level of energy, let's just say happily driving a car and listening to some music you could be producing elements and micro compounds that have never existed before and because they're not attached to your bubble of hologram they will fall out behind you like dust particles, micro dust particles. They are not attached to the hologram because the paradox is bringing them through the membranes of reality. Fairy dust! Yes, this is just another way that the entire planet from ground up is here to resolve karma. Even the leaves are designed to fall a certain way to resolve karma. The entire surface timeline on this planet is a machine to resolve karma. As our shards, parts and avatars are working together in unison and harmony together with our environment we are creating potent and powerful elements in awareness or unawareness. The more we are in our joy and authentic expression we can create magic like that. The fact that we are not surrounded by all those rare and hidden elements and metals in our city structures and homes the lack frequency is being amplified.
CHAPTER VII: SIGNATURE FREQUENCY TEACHING – THE LAWS OF ATTRACTION AND REPULSION INSIDE AND OUTSIDE CONSCIOUSNESS ENTANGLEMENT.
Q: What is a signature frequency? You are an I AM self driven wave form in a bubble of reality that has physics adjusting you to your harmony, vibration and frequency based on your ability to propagate life in equal co-creation and non-hierarchy with your celestial counterparts. Your signature frequency is a naturally evolving attraction process in coherently aligning to the seen and unseen world based off raw vibration, frequency, harmony. When our cognitive mind gets involved in it you often are forcing a match that is in our time-space equation for which you might not be ready yet. Depending on the level of your awareness that can easily turn into an instant gratification journey.
Q: What makes you a match to a signature frequency? What makes you a match to this material? It is not necessarily about your consciousness. Our agencies work at the universal source level because we are universal beings resolving universal karma at any moment in time. The I AM just happens to be the time spaced cognitive manifestation in all awareness that is fractionalising around you. Spirituality is beginning to make sense within the infinite fractional or great mystery and begins to be clued in to its moods and themes. The great mystery is never going to be solved but it is going to give you some foreshadowing and sometimes even predictions. THE COLLECTIVE CONSCIOUSNESS IS A LIMITATION – YOU’VE GOT TO THINK BEYOND THAT. The individual and the collective consciousness will always be a limitation as we are infinitely evolving beings with infinite possibilities available to us. You can be a signature frequency match individually, collectively or separately and as I said it has nothing to do with your consciousness.   Like creates like and dislike creates dissonance. Your consciousness gives consent but the universal frequency, vibration and harmony can match you without your consciousness entanglement.
Q: What is a forced signature frequency match? You have to take responsibility at the level of awareness to become a coherent vibrational match. Whenever you are trying to cognitively force a match you are not in the state of emanation allowing the natural ways of the universe to naturally fractionalise and align synchronicities, harmony, vibration, frequency with you. AS LONG AS YOU ARE TRYING TO CONTROL THE OUTCOME YOU MISSED THE EXPERIENCE. It is like a song felt in the heart. As a base understanding you have to perceive first and then cognitise what is a natural neutral being versus a being of charge and polarity. Have you ever come across someone who is trying to match your signature frequency? What does it feel like? Kind of sticky, eeky, needy, the dating world would be a good example of that. We are potent and can out-create anything and anyone with the potency of a few blinks if we believe in our potency, with faith in ourself that has self-mastery, discipline and love as its foundations. The system of domination and control is a forced signature frequency match as it uses its foundation to make a prediction model.
Q: What is tacit consent & being sovereign? Tacit consent is when we adhere and fall for their forced evolution in unknowingness You must acknowledge and learn how to own your unseen consenting process. No answer is still an answer. No choice is still a choice. Sovereignty Is the full right and power to be a governing body of one's own self, without any interference from outside sources or bodies seen and unseen, physical and nonphysical. It is your free will expression at all levels of experience. Declarations of Sovereignty and non consent are magic as they undo spells and commitments you made without having full knowledge or memory. Claiming sovereignty will begin to transform your life and allow you to co create in your full capacity as a free willed multi-dimensional, universal being. To be sovereign we must practice free will at all times
Q: What happens in Global Mass Meditations? The SCHUMANN RESONANCE is part of the natural frequency, vibration, harmony signature that allows us to unify or separate as we go through a fractionalisation process. Think of it as a carrier wave for a given region. In the absence of this frequency, we as humans become ill. The same can be said if our personal frequency is too far out of alignment with the resonant frequency of an area. What happens in mass meditations is that these frequencies are spiking, basically just because a lot of beings are hitting their instruments at the same time. This giant wave in the celestial consciousness, which is its own key of creation, allows a greater fractionalisation to make harmony, frequency and vibrational matches.  Many of the subcarrier waves then try to force the main carrier wave to conform. If it does not conform it allows the many others to fall into chaos which is run by the universal key. Long story short the carrier wave has many sub carrier waves that relates to your time-space equation as a 7th or 8th colour time being.  When everyone uses there instruments not all have the same intentions or levels of awareness to impact on the seen and unseen worlds. So stay away from those mass events, keep your vagus nerve tuned up and let the I AM explore consciousness at the scale and size it is ready and prepared for. Those frequency, harmony, vibration matches that are happening a very big scale cannot always perceived, known, understood and made absolute. That is the limitation of consciousness and there are levels of the experience that the consciousness cannot compute. The signature frequency teaching ties into coherence, both on an individual and collective level, so we can actually start creating music instead of just producing noise.
Q: What do you mean when you talk about SACRED NEUTRAL STATE OF AWARENESS? Polarity takes you out of resonance with your natural frequency, harmony, vibration signature. When you feel everything you have the mind overwriting the heart or the other way round and they are no longer in resonance. Sovereign neutral is a state of observation that has no agenda. It is simply there to perceive the information, cognitively understand it but not create stories with it the present moment. The post being, together with your postcognitivie work force, you can use the information and create a story afterwards. Being in the sacred neutral point of view is a living experience that has the potential to create powerful chemical memories that can be powerful light memories that we can go back to and look at and go over in a non-sacred neutral state. We can retain or go back to certain memories only in the sacred neutral state. That’s why I am so consistent in what I do. I can go back to a sacred neutral place because I know there are certain memories I can only perceive and work with in the sacred neutral state. When you are the pure sacred neutral observer and experiencer at the edge of the unknowningness a magical flow of data is accessible to you. It is a state of beingness that requires trust. The I AM is fully 100 in the vagus nerve, fully in the central nervous system, seen and unseen, sympathetic and parasympathetic, all programs are shut off and it allows the experience to instantly create powerful chemical memories and powerful light memories that can have very long lasting effects on the beingness past, present and future. It is a state of true creation. Finding passion through the infinite unlimited point of view without cognitive function behind it always puts you on the edge of the unknown and makes it easy for the unknown to become known. Ponder that!
 
Q: What is a chemical memory versus a light memory? A person can continuously produce chemical memories, feelings, when stuck in programs at a very low empowered state. As you gain the power of the vagus nerve, any memory that has been layered over and camouflaged with low frequency vibration, can be recalled. We all have the capacity to remember all of our childhood memories, no matter how traumatic or joyful. Chemical memories can be overharvested and lower their frequency of the memory (other I AM memories) whereas memories made in light will continue to re-energise you. Light memories are mystical experience that defines the universe. There is a point in where the experience is so high in frequency, vibration and harmony, where finite chemicals can no longer be sustained. The experience is turned into an infinitely stored in light memory that lights up your consciousness. It is very easy for our consciousness to tune in to this bright light, floating memory in this fractured, fractionalised, unfractured state of beingness. Remember, FEELING IS NOT INTUITION. If you are a feeler you are not using your intuition correctly. You might think you do, but in all reality you are probably stuck in the empath trap. Intuition does not have an agenda, whilst feelings to. RAW INTUTION DOES NOT USE EMOTIONSL INPUT FOR COGNTIVE DATA.
Q: Does chemical memory impact on our homeostasis and synthesis? When the body is overloaded with chemical memory it is then going to continue to produce memories of this finite chemical level. At times you may have a very powerful chemical memory, sex, business… but it is not an ecstatic euphoria that lasts for months. You’ve had experiences that have truly motivated you  and can tell the difference between a finite and infinite experience and memory that just lasts. The programs that we are using generating same old broadcasts that lead to repetition and not illumination. With an overload of chemical memories the programs literally kick us out of the body and we are no longer present which can lead to depression, regression, obsession through entity intra and interaction. Chemical memories are using the body as a permanent storage unit that can create many types of degenerative diseases. We are being of HOMEOSTATIC SYNTHESIS, a state of personal freedom and awareness for growth and the patterns we create are to promote our own evolution with our purpose and place in this world. It is our legacy and birthright to be in synthesis with all there is was and ever will be.
Q: What does being present really mean? Present is a choice in a state where the I AM is inside the body, actively choosing to be in the moment of now, without strategy and agenda, so the infinite moment of now can be I AM realised, processing a state of presence as an ever moment to moment living. This is the I AM being fully in the vagus nerve, the mitochondrial power plants, fully empowered to experience the mighty moment of the now, inside and outside and many other linear and none-linear expressions of time – simultaneous living in the present moment. When you are in the vibration, harmony, frequency alignment out of a non-cognition choice.
Q: How do we impact the cosmos by sending out our energies? It is kind of like when the TV is playing in the background. The frequency of the TV impacts us on some level although we are not really focusing on the specific program. The background noises can make us slightly irritated or eventually can get us to pay attention. It often is far more distracting than we all want to admit. It also has a time-space stamp on it that does not evolve with our internal time-space equation of Roman Numeral Time. Just about everything you see or hear on TV is recorded in the past even most live shows are on a delay. Remember, frequencies are light and light is technology. Any type of sending out light waves can interfere with your or other’s light wave production as it still is unprotected technology. We can be like cell towers but unless we understand our potency, the need for sovereign boundaries and the I AM APEX fortification we are far from acting as protected technology. Many offworlders are here now because of us doing the work. It has affected them in ways we don’t understand as of yet. What we can say is that the universal agency is sending in top quality managers and staffers.
Q: How does communication through HARMONY/FREQUENCY/VIBRATION signature work?
Every communication is multidimensional in universal nature. An expansive communication is based on the BROADCASTER AND THE RECEIVER LOOKING AT THE MATCH OF THE 3 WAY FORMS OF INTERACTION of frequency/vibration/harmony. By talking to one or more in the seen world, a multitude of beings, past and future in the seen and unseen are listening. A high frequency statement can be low in harmony meaning that it creates powerful sparks, not necessarily in the now but later in time for people listening in archives and beyond.
 
1.  	HARMONY: is related to space and time (a powerful statement creating for the future)
2.  	FREQUENCY: is determining of the spark is going to ignite chemical memory that will evolve into a light based memory.
3.      VIBRATION: determines the length in which the energy explosion stays present in the person in the form of euphoria or dopamine release of something else that keeps the experience going. Vibration creates a resonance or an echo factor inside the human’s central core, central nervous system. Programs are stuck inside traumas, sub echos inside the CNS creating this information that is hard for high or low vibration teachings to get through to the central nervous system. There are times where I am building the energy up in a normal conversation. I am cognitively aware I am raising my frequency, raising my vibration, like tidal waves pounding and all of a sudden the program drops in 30 or 150 people and there is that flood of vibration into them which then creates a chemical response that is not fight, flight, freeze but surrender.
 
Q: Can we talk about choice with regards to the Signature Frequency? HARMONY/FREQUENCY/VIBRATION creates an equation where the conscious mind is consciously trying to entangle out of choice. That is a separate journey from the journey of charge & polarity. Signature frequency moment of the now has the non-cognition and then the cognition process. There is an agenda us who is always trying to force matches out of choice. Choice is technically trying to force the universe to conform. There are certain choices that are backed with daily practice, blissfulness, joy and all those other things that aren’t really forcing but allowing the spirit of god and the universe source, whatever you want to call it, to work with us and through us in a non-competition process. At that level of co-creation synchronicities can be aligned that create blissful awareness and experiences and we don’t force them out of a need to control.
Q: Could you define FREQUENCY in this context? Think of frequency as the intensity of light emission. So, frequency determines how much ability you have to affect everything that’s in one degree of separation of you on all dimensions, time streams, and existences. the spark, intensity, potency creating a light memory that later solidifies. That potent power of a blink in a middle of a speech that effects everyone. 9 words in a speech, I have a dream MLK… expressing the frequency of him being present in his body, fully in his central nervous system, broadcasting his light out of choice. Frequency will determine how much you can set other beings to by burning fuel, stagnant energy to raise their frequency. It doesn’t come from words but your presence in your body, how much light you are exuding. You can be a high frequency being in a low vibration: you spike, you drop, you spike, you drop. Frequency is an experience but it may not be congnitive experiences with regards to universal vibration and harmony because there is no cognition when you making signature frequency match to the moments of now.
Q: How do we define VIBRATION? Vibration is connected to a period of time. How long can you stay present in your body? The longer waveform, where frequency can spark up high producing a lot of light like a lighthouse, versus your vibration is always putting that much light out. It’s like how much light are you putting out over a longer period of time…. HOW PRESENT YOU ARE AS A DNA INSTRUMENT EXPERIENCE OVER LONGER PERIOD OF TIMES. Technically we can use vibration as the container but the body is an instrument of experience and vibration is an experience too.
Q: What is meant by HARMONY? How you can none cognitively match the environment around you using frequency and vibration and pattern moment to moment to moment in a none-congnitive, none-linear, none pattern recognition way, naturally in harmony with that blade of grass, naturally in harmony with all projections of the natural world to you. You have to go into the none-choice to truly understand frequency, harmony and vibration – it is more than looking at sacred neutral. There is none-cognitive, non-choice part of you that is in this reality that has a base harmony, frequency, vibration that is influenced by how much we are creating experiences in aware or unawareness. Our skinsuits are programmed to harmony – that other 20% - 7% harmony, frequency, vibration and the remaining 13% makes up how spiritual codes and contracts unfold in linear and none-linear time. What agencies you work or don’t work with as well as how non-time beings can consciously entangle with the time based you to create a brand new contract that is need for change, auditing of the self (dark night of the soul)
Q: How can we practice HARMONY/FREQUENCY/VIBRATION ALIGNMENT?  There is all sorts of guided meditation that can help you understand the pendulum of harmony, frequency, vibration that you are, always have been and ever will be. You created a pattern long before you were awake and now you are using  conscious choice to continue this creation and become more aware of the patterns. Balance is acknowledging two sides with a part in the middle saying don’t compete with those sides. Sound Therapy is a very effective tool to work with harmony, frequency and vibration. Have you ever experienced the sound waves created by playing a GONG or singing bowls?  There  you are being bathed in frequency, harmony, vibration. When people have strong reactions in a gong bath it is the frequency emission that can create chaos within them putting their programs on the defence. They can’t really process the information carried by the the sounds, the continuous interchange of authority between them and their programs. It can be challenging to stay in your body throughout such an experience as the programs can keep interfering with your sovereignty rules. Any form of sound, the out loud name it to claim it system, that right away allows you to be a frequency, harmony, vibration via your vocal expression. It is saying to the programs, this is me, in me, for me, as me and you are not me, you are a part of me. When you record and listen to your voice you have to go through the cognition of your own vibration, frequency and harmony as a subconscious match and none-match. Swimming in the ocean, boating on a lake, walking, athletics, sacred places, ceremony, nature…. Are these just conscious or unconscious entanglements or are they experiences beyond chemical finite comprehension ? There are people living next to a sacred place that is constantly effecting them in unawareness. The goal is to get the stagnant electromagnetic energy out of the body to become a match to vibration, harmony and frequency out of a conscious entanglement and disentanglement through a cognitive and non-cognitive process.
Q: How does DENSITY impact our DNA Instrument of experience? Density determines the ultimate power level, micro vaults versus macro vaults. There comes a point where the 7 chakras we are looking at via perception become micro vaults and we access our 8th chakra that becomes macro vaults, the 8th to our 16th chakras becomes micro vaults and then the next level becomes macro vaults as we begin to learn to operate on the different scales of time that require our awareness base to understand the original awareness was in micro vaults, became macro vaults, becomes micro vaults to become a macro vault awareness at the next level of density which allows you access to the lateral dimensions of awareness. There is an infinite amount of dimensions and our DNA skinsuit gives us access  off our DENSITY. Talking about dimension versus density, the more density we have in our embodied state (the more soul shards integrated) the more dimensions we can perceive. Our skinsuits can perceive 50 colours of time which means that if we were 99% on the way to highest form of awareness, awakening as high masters we could perceive tens of thousands of dimensions. Every dimension can have an infinite amount of life form in it or no lifeform but infinite awareness. Not all dimensions have tangible or intangible space or constructs that are sharable and not all dimensions are a hologram either.
Q: Can you elaborate more on the colours of time and the FOETUS OF THE WOMB PROCESS? Our DNA skinsuits have a potential to work within 8 colours and 9 bodies. This would require though consciousness to be willing to drive the DNA experience @ 2000 miles an hour and break the mock barrier. Here we are talking about super LUMINAL THINKING which is your DNA birth right as a DNA lineage being. Whilst you have the technology of super luminal thinking you may not be able to fully explore that just yet. Take a younger soul riding its consciousness @200 miles an hour for a few lifetimes but eventually is going to crash. Currently in our world we are a 7 colour time experiencing world. The vast majority of worlds out there is 2 or 3 colours. A smaller percentage are 4,5 and 6 colour worlds ie Arcturians, Pleiadians they can have multiple frequencies of individual time on the surface of the planet but their worlds don't use roman numeral time. They can use dozens of colours and create more if the factions on the planet choose it. You can have a variety of beings that come to a 7 colour world. Their DNA can only experience 3 colours but their world allows them to have layers of reality. We live in a multi layered UNI WORLD. There are 2 colour experiencing beings right next to you, layered on top of you, aware of you and unaware of you. The rocks, the wall, the blades of grass are life force energy of 2 colour experiencing time. A 3 colour experiencing time might be something like a cricket or a clan of crickets that is actually one soul or a hive of bees that may be two souls in six or seven thousands bees.
Let’s say in the foetus in the womb blueprint process a previous I AM that used to be a 2 colour experiencing being determines that it wants to elevate to a 3,4,5 colour being. It will then go to the astral city soul family related to them in the NORTHPOLE (past) Aurora Borealis and spend time there charting a course of what types of soul families it wants to work with before it transits to the SOUTHPOLE (future) signalling to earth mother to enter the EARTH incarnation grid. There is where it will spend a frequency what is called blue road time in which it comes into the foetus state. It waits for an egg or sperm or seed which has its own technology and chooses the right astral process to become an animated being. As a sperm based being the mother and father create the portal of the lineage and the being that is in the blue road astral time becomes the first spark. The nine month gestation process is where the former 2 colour being learns to experience all 7 colours of time through their parents. That is the first imprint upon the foetus in the womb process. This is why it is so vital as practitioners of your own healing that you return to the foetus in the womb state and once again get communal access to the growth of the blueprint to be able to create changes. Upon birth the foetus forgets everything that happened in the astral worlds, all the programming it has done in the North and South Pole. It no longer remembers that it had access to the earth mother’s incarnation grid and that it planned its life with the tens of thousands of beings and made spiritual contracts to create true and false synchronicities. It no longer is aware of all temporary synchronicities that put it on multiple frequencies or timelines because this is a 100 % free willed universe. Free for all denizens where the domination and control exists, tries to predict our life journeys whilst we learn to plan big and long term.
Q: Can you say more on the prediction of us through the system? The system gets to read your spiritual contracts that you are making with everyone else and makes a prediction of how effective you are going to be at it and it is going to put things in your way called karmas. Karmas are a repetition process that usually have no illumination as the system wants to make sure that the foetus in the womb is working extra hard during the nine months where it has infinite access to all the physical beings in and out of manifestation until its birth. This is the time of the greatest amount of light where this being can be in service and contribution to a master collective of beings of light who are still an uncollective during the time of the initial spark’s creation. That leads to the great forgetting and the living and growing of beings in mass processes in which we are creating new generations of beings who are now existing with race amnesia. The system has been selectively redating aspects of history so there is not a common colloquial representation to rely on thus why the mandala effect is a consequence in retribution for those that are manipulating the natural order. We are now getting to the point of evolution of this particular world where the previous systems of control, the apparatus of domination and control, can no longer predict what that previous 2 colour time being was going to do in its infinite state of prediction and blueprint.
Q: What can we do as conscious beings on the path of consciousness exploration to inspire change? Lead a life path where consciousness exploration is a protected sacred ritual for your future selves in which you are a discerned practitioner of discipline. By doing these things here in the now you are affirming and confirming to the unseen world you are ready for the next layer of unfolding. The more responsibility you take for your own awareness the more you impact on the consciousness of millions of global beings. Stop smoking the ‘hopium’ pipe and allow your authentic truth, that your inner genius can spark forward at any moment in time to wow this world with a song, inspiring words, artwork, or a business. Do whatever you desire with such force and impact on the self that the world will look your way, be inspired and empowered by your contributions. It is all about living as sovereign masters in the sacred neutral, creating multiple hubs of interconnectivity, being joyful and compassionate whilst living and creating without end. We are all in it for the universal conscious community to win it. How can we use the system against itself? I will go and learn about what makes this world a greater place as part of my inner martial arts discipline as the eternal student and self-illuminated master no longer dependent on external gurus but seeking peers as true impeccable teachers in my reality.
Q: How does faith feature in the consciousness exploration journey? Faith is a choice as it is part of consciousness, part of our responsibility of being the architect of our reality. Faith also have the sides of it that are non-choice. There are those moments where faith propels us onto to the bridge of experience and puts us on the other side instantaneously, which gives us a powerful experience in light memory which we call metaphysical. A near death experience, a person who was an atheist comes out and has now faith in god and the other side. That cleared out all of the negative programming that is around the non-judgemental belief programming. Faith on the non-agenda level. Spirit and faith is working through us and not against us. It is our judgment and condemnation that make us think that the universe is working against us. It is choice until surrender to spirit is no longer choice but an extended flow of experience. We can choose to stop the experience at any time but we don’t.
 
FEELINGS & ENERGY HARVESTING:
Q: How do feelings lower the harmonic wavelength? Very carefully, certain feelings have a certain vibration that you put out that alters your light. Anger can raise your frequency and your vibration but it will push things away from you or will look at matching something with you so that anger goes from you into something and back into you… getting back into the law of charge and polarity. This then makes you a perfect subject for energy harvesting or negative thoughts, feelings, creation of internal demons. Once you step out of the zone that you could be harvested it means your daily practice has meant something to you over  a period of time that creates a vibration in you that is ever present that denies low vibration but high frequency beings interfering with you.
Q: What do you mean by HIGH FREQUENCY AND LOW VIBRATION INTERFERENCE…. Negative beings can be high frequency beings and low vibration. They hit us with a high frequency wave, we respond to and then they lower our frequency to their level. Let’s say you have a person that is not in charge of their I AMness, has a ghost in them that is hungry, and it influences you to blow up at you in a road rage incident sending all this toxic rage at you. As soon as you scream back form most people they have already entangled with it and the interfering being is feeding off both sides through the exchange of charge and polarity -  a high frequency exchange of charge and polarity.
Q: How does one respond to a high frequency, low vibration interference? When the energy hits you from a high consciousness being you can respond in many different ways and you don’t have to exchange energy. And that’s just a choice that you make as an intention. There is baby and adult intention and then a practiced disciplined person over time can make this at a choice all the time.  Just who you are can out-vibrate a person and that usually triggers competition in the other person. Non-competition, non-hierarchy, as a state of emanation is a state of out vibrating and out creating them so that their energies can’t stick and force an exchange of force and polarity. Understanding why other people act the way they do you are empathetically entangling with them. Theses are those false synchronicities that we are creating within ourselves where we are not realising that we empathise with them in order to understand them. IF YOU THINK YOU WON’T BE ABLE TO STAND A WORLD IN WHICH LIVING IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN UNDERSTANDING THEN GIVE UP MAGIC NOW. Most of the time understanding is a very limited form of experience. It’s a micro part of a greater memory and often understanding leads us into curiosity learning because we use it in the mechanical form albeit indoctrinated through the global narrative of having to understand each other.
 
CHAPTER VIII: CONSCIOUSNESS EXPRESSED THROUGH COMMUNICATION & LANGUAGE
Q: How does language and consciousness work together? The DNA instrument of experience uses consciousness to convert light into sound to create memories. We perceive, receive, interpret, store and express ourselves in words that are codes, multidimensional patterns what we call language. Language is a learned individual aspect and experience where we technically are using the 20% part of our DNA.
You may know multiple languages,  speak in one language but process and think in another until you become fluent. As a skilled linguist you can speak seven or eight languages and easily switch between them. Language is a form of communication, consciousness being expressed verbally, emotionally and physically. The written word is light information stored in ink and it may take hundreds of thousands of years for the data to be perceived as light again. Language is a choice beyond cognition. It is the currency – a current energy voltage going through you.  It is a medium to express oneself and yes sometimes there are many currents going back and forth like in an opera, where there is singing and dancing that are accentuating and punctuating and making the language far more interpretive. The interpretation of the music, the parameters of the lyrics, the voice and the resonance. We think in perfect sentences but there was a time when we were learning languages and we struggled to find the perfect sentence but it still all made sense in our head. The light of our mind, that is in the pureness of our consciousness knows what it is trying to say and it translates it from light into sound accurately. Syntax and sense can be independent of each other: “colourless green ideas sleep furiously”. It doesn’t have to make sense to feel good. The light has been modified with the intonation process to create more light. So, let’s say MLK: I have a dream, I have a dream,…. Taken out of context it means not much but in context I have a dream for a unified world.  SYNTAX, when used correctly, allows the actual intonation process to create these flashes of light, that will then create more flashes of light.
We can perceive memories in light not just as a chemical memory. We live in a world of quotes and there are many texts that have jumped thousands of generations. How many quotes from 2000 years ago are still relevant today? How many quotes jump generations? How music jumps generations, Pink Floyd, Metallica – they were great performers. Their music was transformative over generations of time. This is when we talk about the light encoded memories we decipher and encode, the super illuminal thinking comes in. Behind the words in a quote is the consciousness that created them and the other consciousness that has used and reused them to make an impact. You can call our libraries the uncollected collective. Even though they are collected in one place and adhere to the dual decimal system before they were put onto the internet etc. As a reader of any text you read between the lines, you become part of the creation of what it took to create a book.
Q: The significance of grammar and flow? Grammar is all about how sentence flow together to create a sensation. Diagramming sentences, the breaking up and assembling of the words, the nouns, the pronouns so you understand the mathematics of creating a sentence in English at that particular time.  That alone does not make you a good talker or writer. You still have to be able to authentically emanate the words it is more like the nature of teaching.
Technically, language is spacial awareness. The spacial positioning of the letters that create words doesn’t need to be a mathematical formula that has the power of cognition behind it. This is why grammar and syntax are the consciousness’s way of adding a lot more intuitive wisdom into the statement itself, adding more to the code. When you look at words in waveforms, sound waveforms you can see patterns that look like the DNA intertwinement. Technically when we are talking we do exchange DNA, light at a higher perspective level. DNA changes through the observation, interaction between different types of consciousness and everyone allows a different layer of change. There are certain phrases that can put a shock into a person’s system and send them on the track of enlightening understanding or down a darker path. It all depends on the level of programs the person run on how they receive the flow of data.
Adding myth to language is a whole different process and then the subsequent trees of energy that are around myth and how we empower them. Language has its own consciousness. When you are open to going to the edge of unknowingness and you remain in a steady easy flow you allow knowingness to shine through your words and sounds. Let’s use the state of the child. If they are in a learning state and they are exploring, words, places, positions often they have focus, a strategy behind as they understand placement, position and timing. Some children are self-learners how do you know these words? The language in the text, in the light reflected something onto the supra genius that exists within language and annunciation itself. If you hit an annunciation perfectly it creates a euphoric feeling within you – there is an actual dopamine journey behind owning that fluent form. Where there are no barriers, the language becomes the instinct and pattern recognition. A child is listening long before they are speaking.
Q: Does thought create language or language create thought? Consciousness creates all of that. There are subsections within language, the conversation of language that allows consciousness to have many different forms of expression. A thought in a conversation is fluid. I don’t know what I am going to say next but I have an intention behind it by continuing my conversation that maintains a conscious state of focus to continuously create form of light into sound, light into sound creating a lasting memory that I can cognitively understand the nature of our conversation. Thoughts can be stimulated by words, and at times they are not. Take a CONVERSATIONAL TERRORISTS who brings up emotional subject matters that take away from the focus of what you are trying to get to. An avoidance mechanism stopping their consciousness from being a part of the thought and the programs are running thought language not the consciousness. They are having well-versed programs taking over beyond their cognitive choice.
Q: Learning a new language – the mechanics of creating words and sounds?  You are looking at the mathematical journey of structure. Mastering the body’s annunciation and conjugation journey by using intonation, the starting and stopping of the nasal process. There is a mathematical formula about mastering the tongue, the nose, the throat, lips and how the innate body language of each language effects the intonation journey. It is a micro understanding how fluent energy works together with all those pieces and parts. The Inhalation of air from the lungs, the trachea, the larynx, the vocal cords, the force of the tongue, the nose manipulating the sounds to make intonation resonance with the lung. With certain words the sound resonates from the lungs to our nose. The subtleties on how the wind form the lungs is being used is intricate to the language. All of those mechanics is what makes learning a new language difficult.
Q: What is the significance of the tongue when it comes to communication? The tongue is the second organ that gets created after the heart. The tongue takes the vibration direct from the heart and sends it to the tip of the tongue so that heart vibration is the base of our language. The tongue is also emanating an energy that we perceive in light, just there is a morse code the position and placement of the tongue and teeth creates a piezoelectric effect on the teeth which creates an electromagnetic effect in the body which is all that unseen energy of expression. By just talking to people I can tell from the electromagnetic impulses that are coming in if the person is present or not. Another part of the medical intuition journey is to determine programs, self-created demons, internal demons, external demons as there is all different electromagnetic impulses coming through. The roof of your mouth has three plates to it and they determine how all the chi is spread over your body. If they are very tight and you have a sunk nasal passage there is an occupying presence that is taking away from the greater you to express. The sinus and those three plates create a vibration, a completion of your expression. If something is being hijacked it will be in the roof of the mouth and the nasal passage. The tongue is like a morse code, where it is tapping it is creating electromagnetic signalling which the brain is receiving as language. The heart is sending the language through the tongue and the brain receives it.
Q: What do you mean by holographic language? There are conversation where you go beyond the five senses which is the holographic perception of the language suspended in people’s consciousness as they are processing it. Some people process faster than others. Slow processors have a better understanding of the subject matter in the long run because they don’t allow themselves to be overwhelmed by the data, or overprocess and don't miss nuances.
Q: How do aliens perceive our language? We are technically analog speakers who are trying to achieve a dual process, being analog and a digital thinker simultaneously whereas the offworld species no longer operate in binary coding. They can think from many different perspectives which allows them to have a greater understanding of the unlimited point of view. As we are coming out of the infancy of our understanding of the unlimited point of view our language can be multidimensional at a basic leven and still be expressive in many dimensions and perceptions. They are waiting for us to come out of our limitation the language imposes on us because the global narrative doesn’t allow the language to evolve into a multidimensional thinking capacity.
Q: How can we make our language more multidimensional? Add emojis and don’t be limited to the 26 letters of alphabet that we have now. What would a new letter look like? Start adding smiley faces to the language, symbols to modify what you are saying. Children create a new language all the time and it is the previous generation trying to understand the modern generation’s language which comes to the term the COLLOQUIAL NOW. The colloquial now includes the MYTH that the modern generation know, perceive and use. The colloquial now is ever evolving and new myths are created all the time which impact on the language and many people don’t know the new myths. There are lot of people still thinking DVDs will come back and some have yet to figure out CDs. They are all done, there is no future market for them as we can’t stop the evolution. We are already creating a multidimensional language. How can we do it even more cognitively and make our own language, linguistic samples? The modern kids are naturally using the power of myth to create intentionality by communicating in movie quotes.
Q: How does communication and language impact on our aura? Lightworkers have bastardised auras. They want to simplify it and make you think you can understand it instantly. Your aura is an ever evolving process that is impacted by language which effects a series of patterns within patterns that determine why the colours are there or not there. Auras are an adaptive system and many people can actively deceive you by making their aura go one way and think another. Why do you think lying works? So many people say why doesn’t a psychic know they are being lied to? You have to understand the perceptions of colour. Does that person believe that he or she is not doing any harm by lying in the very moment they do? It is a camouflage for all sorts of negative reasons. If the light worker community would stop bastardising the colour teaching we would understand why lying works. We’d have a much better chance of perceiving it in the moment. Some can hear lies. We all have a bullshit detector and sometimes it needs an upgrade. Some people’s capacity of broadcasting bullshit is good and we need to stay out of charge and polarity, which is the main influencer why lying works. Con artists manipulate your own charge and polarity and you fall into the victimhood trap.
Q: What do you call a conversational terrorist and how can we counter one? For a conversational terrorist their point of view is the only one that counts. People will often delude themselves into believing their own words and present them as a gospel truth. They are trying to disrupt your thoughts and see everything through a right and wrong perspective. They keep babbling without making much sense and try to lure you into emotional outbursts or defeat. Best way of dealing with a person like that is to shut your energy field down and increase your light manyfold so that they can’t suck your energy. It will return their poison as they can’t handle that high frequency light. Learn how to manipulate the energy of a conversation without stepping on someone’s journey by out vibrating them and without allowing them to harvest your vibration. You can use body language to innately fortify yourself without them ever recognising what you are doing. You can nullify the demon inside the other person by making them repeat something so difficult that they cannot cognify it so that the soul has to come in for a moment and then chuck out the rest. Laughter is always the best tool to avoid getting harvested. Reverse the frequency which will infuriate them and make them speechless even if just for a moment. Don’t fall prey to their astral minefields where you think you should have said this or that as it puts you into charge and polarity. You have to know what the nature of you is in the moment and what is required. A conversational terrorist is trying to kick you out of the body. Am I talking to the program or the person, what is the difference? Stop giving all your data and information to those who can’t or want to hear it. The universe has a special plan for all those who are stuck in this self-delusion. Trust the universe, and stop investing into those that are so self-deluded that there is nothing you can say to change them in the moment. The more you work within the rules of your personal sovereignty through daily rituals, monthly ceremonies, weekly hindsight and foresight the less you will encounter people that.
 THE SPIRITUAL MECHANICS OF COMMUNICATION & HEALING
 Q: What are some of the mechanics you can share with us when it comes to multidimensional communication, facilitation and healings? Ok, let’s talk about what I do when I have a client or caller that comes with defensive energies. I have to raise my frequency and go into a super sacred neutral state with the intention to not entangle and out vibrate that person and the audience. I am doing all of that at the same time. In order to out vibrate the audience I find the highest frequency being, that is listening past/present/future because the show will be an archive for future listeners, and I exceed it by a hundred fold. Whenever that defensive person is speaking his or her words are not able to stick to my vibration and frequency as I am not holding their charge and polarity. Right away the universal laws allow immediate cognition of the past, present and future beings who are in a conversation with me and allows me to see them like an open book. I have to consciously turn pages and that is me probing and asking questions to set the stage for them to create lasting memories. Ultimately what I am doing with the skill is figuring out what is going to stick in the caller’s memory and then in everyone that is listening. Every individual person will have something that applies to them, a memory that will last more than six months – that’s my goal. That puts the responsibility back to the callers and listeners to take it on or not.
 
Q: What is the difference between a normal Andrew reading and a hotseat in a group setting? The flame is hotter in helping a person to see what needs to change in more depth. In a group setting there is also the learning aspect for the participants as well as the contributions. The one in the hotseat needs to take full responsibility to be roasted. Everyone in the group has to be totally present. What is different for you Andrew? There is a major difference when I have a group of people as I will bring up a more involved context. I talked about these healing groups where you have a few people in the background and one is doing hands-on work where I bring in galactic doctors and hands-on psychic surgeons, as part of the hub of interconnectivity, to the crown chakra of the practitioner. When there is a room of people holding space for the practitioner and the person going through the healing with the intention of bringing all the collective doctors of the galaxies and universe to your awareness in a non-competitional format. All of their wisdom is there and in these hotseats I am doing that and each person that is present is connected to their galactic healing entourage and they become a mass of a collective that can make the surgery very easy.
Once the person in the hotseat is in an empowered state he or she can tap into the collective of empowered healers and do the work. Readings are different depending on if the person is ready for that level of healing. In the hotseat I am trying to get the receiver of the hotseat to take over the collective of wisdom that is there and to apply it through their own actions and words, be a guide for them to confirm whatever needs confirming and have the rest of the group can add their own evaluation to some of the other aspects as each person of the group is also tuning into the collective of guardians and psychic surgeons and getting their own thing out of it.
In a standard reading I am not putting the hub of interconnectivity into the person’s responsibility layer. There are times when I am dealing with a uniquely potent powerful person that has been avoiding their power for a very long time and that is what their soul has actually contracted me to do. I put the weight of responsibility to be in the body and use the skill to have a sample of what it feels like so they can determine afterwards if the memory sticks and they want to follow through to actually have the experience, being super psychic on their own. If the person is not ready bringing in the hub of interconnectivity it could be harmful. It would be me stepping on their journey. It can be easily weaponised against the rest of the universe.
Q: In your shows you talk about THE WHEEL OF CALLERS? Your DNA skinsuit is designed for and because I am doing shows that are generally transformative my frequency, vibration and harmony with non-cognitively is a part of every caller – THE WHEEL OF CALLERS. It creates its own form of synchronicities. I don’t pick the callers, I don’t influence that. That is allowing the universe to be a part of fully allowing the evolving teachings. I am not competing with that as it has its own agenda of what people need in the moment of now. That is bringing the law of frequency, vibration and harmony right into everyone’s face. Lots of callers teaching others at the same time.
Everything I can do you guys can do with enthusiastic mastery and effort with practice and getting over instant gratification. Not to give callers the satisfaction of validation for what is not real. The worst thing I can do as a super illuminal being is give them fake validation, that is not authentic. Everyone has their own wisdom. A question opens up the energy, disburses stagnant energy so that they can start thinking for themselves again. Consciousness is choice. Through daily practice over many years I can bring high frequency vibration and harmony to a show. I can work with a caller and adjust my signature frequency to what is required in the moment taking the multidimensional implications into account which gives me great flexibility of my performance whilst staying  sovereign, unentangled and in my authentic truth.
Q: What are you doing on a multidimensional level when you are inviting the audience in the chatroom to write something? The 68 people in the zoom and the 58 that are typing  what is it doing to the energy in the archive a month from now even though the people in the archive cannot see what is being typed right now.  It challenges them on some level. What is it doing to the energies of those present now who are technically present a month from now? Their post cognitive workforce is bringing energy in and the people that are listening in a month from now is experiencing each and everyone of our energies just by looking for the chatroom even  he can’t see it in the archives. Each and every person here now will have a post cognitive experience and a precognitive experience for all those typing right now for all of those who are going to listen in a month from now wondering about the individual people on the show now. So the people that will listen in a month can you type something now to the audience of the past. The present show audience can go into the youtube video after the show and type something for the people in the future. It is that easy to manipulate time.
Q: How do you know when to say what to a client or caller without stepping onto their sovereignty? When there is a question I am not supposed to answer because they are not ready my 3rd eye moves backwards. The information comes forward out of their reality and my 3rd eye processes it as a projection back to them. This is how I know what not to say to them, like I am not supposed to tell them as they are too unevolved in their practice that it will harm their journey. It would be like stepping on their journey. My 3rd eye acts as a filter or a mirror on who can receive what kind of information depending on the level of their awareness. People can only take on feedback on what their level of awareness is ready to take on. It is almost like my body is telling me when to divulge information or not. You have to learn how to communicate with people and meet them where they are at. In my shows the potentiality of what I can say is getting bigger unless you hear me say I just broke the rules. A question posed to them instead will always assist them to start untangle the problem from within as in truth we all do have our own answers. There is a fine line in stepping on someone else’s journey in awareness or unawareness, conscious choice or unconscious choice. Are you doing it out of vengeance or, as a parent, out of love based discipline or rather triggered by the ancestral lineage where one can be overwhelmed by the ancestral energies. The avalanche of abuse comes down onto the child creating trauma, which again would have also been set up the child through spiritual contracts. Whatever you do, are you doing it with the intention to harm behind it versus unconscious repetition caused by the absence of individual sovereign strength to break and transcend those ancestrally handed down energies? The position of information would ultimately uncover if it was raw creativity or if it is the infinite celestial code. A lot of times when I am writing, solely for the joy of writing I would add lines everywhere, getting thoughts down in a unique, communicate creative flow versus a flow in a session which is a completely different mechanics.
Q: Communication is so much more than just the words we use?  The entire body gets involved when communicating and often the voice cuts out. Words make up the least significant part of our rapport, probably less than 10%. The rest is expressed through our tonality as in tone, tempo timber, volume of the voice & physiology as in posture, gesture, breathing, facial expressions, blinking of the eyes. I often use the hand positions when going through dense material, using the streams of light in my hands to examine the field and the strands I want to connect to. It is like moving the sheets of information around to get to the specific data faster, a way of determining sub information and how that effects the whole. It is almost like I am using the hands to complete a spiritual process.
Q: How are we using our eyes and 3rd eye to communicate? We are usually accessing information through our eyes. The more we observe ourselves on recordings we can get a better understanding of how the body positions itself naturally to give certain experiences. In the eye generation journey your 3rd eye is the projector and your mind is the receiver of data allowing you to generate thought constructs from the hologram. Remember the SUN JOURNEY MEDITATION where the two eyes activate the 3rd eye. The position of the eyes activates the 3rd eye. The 3rd eye then grabs information out of the field which you can sense omnidirectionally around you. The instrument of experience grabs it from a position in space time. Some people have difficulties to connect through eye contact. They have a stare or look away pattern that indicates that they are not really in the body or ready to leave any moment. A glazed look can also be very positive as in changing the resonance frequency to find matched information. Deep simultaneous gaze & glace can be a searching for a message back in time for the person that will be a signature frequency match for them going forward into the future into a branch of time in which the information mentioned has been stored in memory long enough to create a change. On the negative side it can also mean we are denying matches and reflecting them back out. Haunted people cannot hold a gaze which is quite common. When people are in love and are looking into each other’s eyes their pupils dilate through their auric energy. This helps them to gain an independent appreciation for their energy as the eyes dilate to take in more light and create a denser energy. That would be situation where you find yourself at the edge of leaving the chemical memory state. The position of the corneas in the eye sockets determine what the eyes can perceive versus the brain. The 3rd eye can take in excess data, it has rods and cones just like your regular eyes and they can go omnidirectional whereas our eyes are limited to our front 170 degree line of sight.
 
Q: What are the mechanics when using LIGHT LANGUAGE? When I am speaking light language it is all about what the throat chakra is doing. All of my senses observing the vocal patterns that the reality is observing through the throat chakra. The knowingness is in the heart but the completeness of the manifestation, just like with any other skill, the final manifestation is in the voice, the throat chakra. I am setting a tone and a frequency. There will be people who don’t know what that language is but they know there is an intonation and a body language and an auric field that is interacting with it is also giving off psychic information that is also the sign form of light language. So when you are light language speaking you are using all parts of your body for the final manifestation for how the reality interprets it as an observer or an unentangled observer. That is the other side of light language you can speak to unentangled observers and be unentangled yet they still get their point across.
You have that right at all times to speak to them. That is the I AM presence apex of this hierarchical order and experience to use these words of command to be in dominion, or communion and union with beings. When beings are not in dominion, communion and union their light language is greatly reduced and only the highest versions of their light bodies can perform the greatest of their tasks. So when you have a being that is using much more light bodies that is much more in communion and union they have much more access to light languages. When your light bodies are calibrating more with I am presence the access of engaging these types of languages through your soul and the voice box becomes easier. The translation is more free flowing, without a verbatim translation. That equation setting has moments of harmony were several phrases before you speak light language can get changed and modified, the expression of photonic light. So I am giving codes to light itself to change an expression, much like a kaleidoscope opening and closing a specific pattern. And I can make multiple sets and patterns throughout the entire conversation. It is almost we remember how to use the frequencies of the voice, intonations to effect reality.
Q: What happens when we are reading out loud? People often can’t annunciate words because their shadow is stopping them, taking out the clarity of the language. When we reading out loud is a way to see and perceive of the programs that don’t want change within us. We are coming into the present moment, I AM in the vagus nerve and starts chucking out programs. Have you ever been into a book you are no longer reading the words and it’s like they are existing in your head? Being transported beyond the words.

CHAPTER IX: DREAMTIME AWAKENING
Q: What is the Earth’s DREAMTIME AWAKENING? The original purpose of earth was linked into the dreaming mind of all solar systems so all karma could be resolved in the dreaming mind of earth. All beings who were on their home worlds and their astro worlds found a rainbow gateway to earth in which they could dream and regain their akashic experience of who they were. We are connected to all dreaming minds of this universe, and our only limitation is our creativity. The more creative you are the more infinite you will be.
 WE ARE STILL CREATING KARMA BUT IT’S NOT AN INFINITE AMOUNT and no matter what we are creating it won’t reach the infinite state again. Think of it as additional time in a football game, no one knows when it is going to end and we are on shoot outs. The Galactic Ascension Machine has finished and we have created a zero sum game for them. Domination and control cannot outcreate the 7+ billion of us no matter how hard they try. It is done, choose to step out of the matrix and focus onto your bubble of reality and dreamtime. Whatever creates joy and abundance for you are the new energies of creation in the now. There is a sense of entitlement in the spiritual communities that is misleading. This is an individual awakening and we will have to come together as a collective until enough people have woken up. We have to create our own bubbles of reality and hold our own frequencies to shed the old skins. The understanding of the signature frequency teaching as well as the significance of our dreaming bodies in this process and how it all fits into our collectives at any particular moment in time can create a universal exchange energy for completion.
Q: What are dreamtime societies? Dreamtime Societies are connecting us to the mind of the universe to improve our evolution as universal beings. They don’t operate via borders, these are portals and synapses to bring information from other dimensions and worlds. They operate via signature frequency which creates the connections, separations and societies, synchronicities that are aligning synchronicities into a theme.
Q: What do we do in dreams and how do we interact with those dreamtime societies?
-        EV/INVOLUTIONARY DTS: Every set of themes creates a set of evolution, involution – those dreamtime societies help potent souls who want to go onto potent dreamtime journeys, such as  enter tens of thousands of places simultaneously to expand their own dreamtime capacity.
-        LOCAL DTS: Then there is the dreamtime of your local city, your country, each of those are different layers of being in a society that is trying to understand evolution, forced evolution in many other subject matters.
-        TRIBAL DTS: There are other dreamtime societies your guides and guardians and religions are part of.
-        ANCESTRAL DTS: When we reach that next level where we working high quality dreaming frequencies and doing missions we working with the astral dream world to create a benefit for the seven past and future generations
-        CELESTIAL DREAM TIME SOCIETY: When we are really superior at dreams we go into the HOLLOW EARTH, the dreaming body of EARTH where she achieves a dream state where she invites other societies from other places, spaces, frequencies, in time to be part of the hub of interconnectivity. Just her dreaming with many other planets simultaneously
Q: Can we choose which society to dream with? Self Mastery is key and will lead to having excursions in the dream world that will have benefits to many dream time societies. We can’t really consciously choose to who we travel with as we haven’t achieved full sovereignty in our dreamworld but we are not limited to what our society tells us. You can claim your sleep time and not be affected your nation’s borders. Revocations only go so far to get you out of mediocrity and then you need to create beyond probably not just in language but art work, with fire and s. Joy is the main river, allow the synchronicities to flow.
Q: What happens when we have overlayered dreams? Certain dreamtime societies help us evolve, involve our next layer, where you are dreaming in many places at once. The purpose is to prove it as a soul that you can do it and the I AM is the direct manifestation to showing the universe that is has happened. It is to validate the great dreamtime awakening to other dreamtime societies who have lost faith that it is coming. A multitude of residual images of undealt emotions calling forth for remedy and resolve. And some residual images need a residual time and that’s why many of them feel layered over. Those time gaps are synchronistic manifestations of multiple time frequencies in a dream. That’s the uniworld, all forms of thoughts, concepts and perceptions layered on top of each other. Different timelines that are not co-dependent on each other, they are each a by product of themselves. We can choose the ala carte system what we want to work on each day. Make the dreaming body a  non-agenda, discipline, co-operation, non-competition, non-hierarchical order by starting at a finite place and connect to the infinite. We can also take short kitty naps with the intention to enter multiple dream states, use Triptophane or ritual prayer to get back to sleep in case of insomnia.
Q: How do we use our DREAMING BODY Drive to manifest? We can use dreaming to resolve karma and install dharma by footing the frequency where karma can no longer hold us back but propel us into creating dharma.  You can make literally manifest in the dreamworld, a solidified memory, that is an actual tangible mind space process where you making tangible dream weave frequencies that are in your photonic light memories you can use to work with.  In order to do that you have to let go of control and expectations. Dream energies can get stuck in the intestinal tract depending on what your journey has been. If you can’t remember your dreams that is often a clue.
The world is in your face so much that your dream frequency is not allowed to perculate more of your awareness. It is important that you have a disciplined approach before you go to sleep and before you wake up – those 10 minutes before you get up are yours. It can be the greatest potency of discipline to reclaim yourself and saying no to your parasympathetic instantly ripping you out of theta into the alpha state. You can also choose to go back to sleep and back in the dream. There is no cookie cutter occasion to defining a dream and remind yourself your mind loves to fill in the blanks. We have been sharing dreams since before there was a society.
Q: Can you talk about the Earth’s dreaming body and our relationship with it? We are all part of earth’s dream. We don’t live in her dreaming body, she’s got her own. We live on her physical body but she is simultaneously dreaming with every living being to create a physical body. When we choose to be part of our dreamworld and engage with different dreamtime communities, organisations, societies on the surface world we become part of her mid or high theta dreaming frequency. When we reach that next level where we working high quality dreaming frequencies and going on missions we are working with the astral dream world to create a benefit for the seven past and future generations. We are dreaming with the CELESTIAL DREAM TIME SOCIETY when we get really superior at dreams we go into the HOLLOW EARTH,  the dreaming body of EARTH where she achieves a dream state and invites other societies from other places, spaces, frequencies, in time to be part of the hub of interconnectivity – just her dreaming with many other planets simultaneously. Her dreaming body is in the Inner Earth and we get access to it when we have done our due diligence and self mastery work. The surface of the world is in mid-hight theta, light delta lucid sleep state. When we enter the LUCID DREAMING STATE, as awakening aware beings we can make powerful manifestations within ourselves and the energies around us. The state of mother Earth’s dreaming body is perfect. There is no need to project unhealthiness onto the EARTH. She’s got a few aches and pains as we are reaching galactic weather triggering arthritis but she isn not that old either to not cope well with it.. 
Q: How can we connect energetically to that dream space? Self-Mastery! Part of self-mastery is learning about what your internal agenda is and understand how we can change this internal agenda through more and advance mastery to explore all the infinite possibilities that are available to us. Retrieving the files, following the map in the skull.  When you activate your crown chakra you activate a million Aurora Borealis thus the dreaming frequency. When we are expelling from our rectum, which is the opposite of the third eye, we are getting the negative dreaming frequencies stuff out of us. Start connecting in meditation to the seven past and future generations through the North and South Pole.
Q: Do we ever lose our dreamtime memories? It all depends how much energy is behind a memory. The amount of energy behind a memory to be manifested from a dream has a certain limitation. Sometimes the amplitude, the maximum vibration is very high but the frequency, the charge isn’t. When we wake up we can add charge and amplitude to it so it becomes manifested. The nervous system plays part in short circuiting the memory process. It is downloaded in the DNA but not always highlighted enough hence hard to find.
Q: How do algorithms connect to dreamtime? Algorithms are a continuous infinite string of perceptions and numbers in which a DNA instrument of experience processes into many different colours of time and space. A human being is a data processing machine, the skinsuit that you wear is the technology, the dreaming world provides for the infinite energy to come into the body to be processed and manifested. We are here to experience NOW, we are clearing the past, to start experiencing the overlay of past, present, future in the moment of now.
Q: What are the dreamtime mechanics with regards to the WESTERN DOOR OF PERCEPTION? The Western doorway of perception opens up for you to see, feel and know where your dreams need to be put. We have a cellular memory that gets stored in the body. The actual skeleton is the biggest data storage device that you have. Your actual skull cap, that encases your brain, has a crystalline structure within where your dreams and heart memories are stored with the brain being an access machine to use it. There are times when you are in an intensive dream, you come out and that data area is completely full. You must move that type of information to another part of your body. After some stage you have them stored all over the body and that’s why you go through these sudden remembrances at times. You think of a person, it’s because the cellular memory became active and triggered a certain information that needed to be put back in its place because its code had gotten so long and makes the system run very slow. A human being is a data processing machine, the skinsuit that you wear is the technology, the dreaming world is the infinite energy, the finite energy comes into the body. Where we cross over from our dreamworld into the physical world is where you can learn about the mechanics of how your dreams are stored. To understand those few moments you have infinity before your mind accepts finite concepts is where you are downloading information from your processing brain and understanding heart into your physical body that your cellular memory is. That is the ultimate concept about the western doorway, where is this information being stored in you.
Q: What do we need to do to use to access the dreaming information?
1.  	Challenge yourself upon wakening. Can you identify your dream, stay in dreamtime? When you hit the snooze button and fall back into your dream you are processing infinity. The brain and heart is processing at a much faster rate, trying to identify points in space and time. There are no such in the infinite space, the mind creates those to perceive and understand it. When you work with DREAMTIME SOCIETIES they create a foundation for the brain to function in. that is called mapping the pathways of past, present, future shamans. When they map these pathways it means your soul group has connections to that point and you are allowed to bring the brain perceptions outside of your body, in the dreamworld, so that you can process, learn.
 
TOTEM Guides, animal medicine, spirit guides who set up the structure for your to learn to communicate with those worlds. This communication is where you are speaking form your heart and your mind is in perfect sink with your heart because during that infinite moment where your heart is connected to the fullness of the spirit world.
In the foetus of the womb, the very first thing that comes forward is your heart. In the heart is a piece of brain matter, the very first concept of your brain and as your body expands, you make a spinal column and a head, the heart separates into two and new brain is formed by the time reaches 20/30 weeks. As the dreamworld infinite you, you found a mother and a father, you’ve gone in, you start out as a heart, your throat, your crown chakra forms and you are still linked to your heart.
 2.  	Keep your body and mind healthy and in homeostasis. Our dreaming body lives in our organs, between the root, sacral chakra and just a little bit above, it does not exist in your head. When you begin to enter a dream state, you drop the three top chakras into the solar plexus. The human body turns off and goes into sleep paralysis. LUCID DREAMING is when all the upper chakras are in the sacral chakra building up this wave pattern before going into the root. This is where you have the sacred, mental moment where you say I want to lucid dream. This is how you battle the programming, the autopilot. All your consciousness into the root, blossoming like a flower, opening over and over and like the Mandelbrot send creates a prism of energy. Like a crystal reflecting the light, that is the beginning of your dreamstate. At the very beginning of your dreamstate is where you set the rules of how you want to remember, you have total control over your cellular memory at that point.
It is the time where the programmer comes in and says, the pain in my back needs to be healed and you can now work on your relationship with off world. Once the root chakra has been programmed  it comes up and you have dream travel, where you enter dreamtime, dreamworlds, where you look to your cellular memories, dreamtime maps, dreamtime compass, that allows you to see the dreamtime houses that are out there so you may project your dreamtime body to these thoughts and experience all these thoughts with all of your mind.
Q: What is it when people show up on your dreams? When people show up in your dreams two things are happening. It is a self-revelation dream where your own self has recreated a residual image of something or somebody that is meant for a specific teaching or you are sharing actual dream space with that person. It usually is the first and otherwise you are not sharing a reality but an expression of an experiental body that is out of phase with the I AM presence self. That is going through higher levels of consciousness exploration in the dreamworld and somehow the body must have a memory of it. Most people are disconnected and cannot remember their dreams. The energy of the dream space is residually there and we can correlate it around our heart and sacrum and create mystical experiences in the future. YOU ARE A TRAVELLER ENERGY.
There are times where we become very loving, we go and visit beings that are under attack and love them and get attached then that spiritual body becomes bloated and that love energy and the other physical body won’t have enough love energy as that spiritual body. You become a litter stalkerish of that other love person until they get attacked again and then you have that burst energy. Over amorous love energy for other non-physical entities at times or physical entities but you are only experiencing them non-physically and you are experiencing their traumas and pains and rapidly defending them. In order to heal that you have to align yourself to the center of your heart, detox the aura each day and improve on your spiritual hygiene.
Q: When you talk about the DREAMWEAVE what do you mean? In our dreamworlds we are going to different bubbles of time realities and recalibrate and weaving together all different times, your dreaming mind is overworking. You can’t remember all these dreams because they are so vast and as a micro being going through the awakening where the third eye, becomes a part of the heart again, so we can learn through heart and mind based expression of duality. You experience is about calibrating time so that people can go into re-alignment that means in your physical life there would have  been phases where you go through something and then a fuse would be lit and then it would be over then you start the next fuse and it would be over and you haven’t finished the process of deeply self-nurturing your self. It is always advisable to disentangle from where you got caught in the trap of false time and light. Karmic retrobuting souls are those that give away their power to the system. Karmic resolvers, contributors, creators and incarnators don't have any karma when they come in. Soul unity is where all your shards are integrated using the same frequency of dreamtime.
Q: What happens when you are not getting accurate dream sleep? Your dreaming body has taken up much more space and sovereignty then it should have. This means you don’t go the full 40 or 50 min or two hours hours that it takes to build up the proper energy that it takes for your body to get ready to leave in a proper way. There are times where the dreaming body just kicks you into sleep paralysis to leave as soon as possible by taking its mission far too seriously. It ignores the heart or it doesn’t leave until it gets answers out of the brain. Our dreaming bodies have their own mission, separate from us but those missions ultimately affect the frequencies of the people we love, hate, need and all those things in between. We are our own teachers, and the dreaming bodies are in the future in their own expression of time that is layered over the IAM presence existence that is not there yet.
You are the I AM Apex presence, here and now for the experience, that includes the sleep experience. Taking the sovereignty back form the dreamworld, so that you get proper dream nurturing, wake up with a spark in your eyes. Even if you don’t remember the dream but you wake up refreshed, like it was twelve hours  asleep that lasted five minutes. It is ok to demand from your dreaming body to change the frequency pattern. You need to preserve enough energy to detect entities, have synchronicities, mystical experiences. You’ve got to begin to recover your energy, look at your sleep patterns. Salt baths, the dreaming body might resist, you are going into neutrality with that salt.
Q: Can you say a bit on the dreaming experience versus an out of body experience and remote viewing? In an OBE we come out of our heart, our third eye and our crown we have a cord attached to our crown, it is a very different experience to the dreaming experience. Remote viewing is just one tiny sample of what is possible now. Part of you is in the North and South Pole, the past and the future When we are remote viewing, we are extending our photonic light expressions. Your power is to control your dreaming body, that means where you belly button, two inches above and below, literally in your intestinal tract. This is how your DNA skinsuit was set up, it is a dreaming skinsuit but it has a time sensitive spirit inside it.
Q: What is a rebellious dreaming body? A rebellious dreaming body can be when you are going into sacred geometry cities, through backdoors to relationships that went toxic, to alter time frames to heal them. All the orders that you have been taking in the physical as well as the dreamworld you must destroy them. These are the things you need to remove from your dreaming body so that the power of your dreaming body is returned to you so when you go to sleep as the I am presence you are telling the dreaming body, you are not dreaming in these places but you are going to the places of our true soul family and we are going to have a soul family reunion. This is my will of the I AM presence and the way of the now. The body at times gets cocky and thinks it is the soul and the soul spark is the experience. It is the other way round.
Q: Taking one’s power back from the Dreaming Body? Salt baths, talking to the fire, any of the tools and techniques you have in your spiritual hygiene toolbox apply them to all the dream times you were forced to conform. Find those times in your life where you chose conformity over authentic expression. Often your dreaming body is making you conform. Toxicity can be a  debt, that was created by others, which we don't need to take on. For the true human potential to be understood we must conquer our own spiritual, physical, social, technological, dreamtime toxicity. We must stop paying attention to Roman Numeral Time and know that we exist in a notime reality. Our skinsuits have skill sets, clairvoyance, clairaudience, clairsentients, telekinesis, aerokinesis, pyrokinesis and a thousand others yet to describe. We co-function in many worlds simultaneously and the disciplines of how is our inherent legacy. Say to your dreaming body: WE ARE COMING INTO UNITY, NEUTRALITY, NO MORE REBELLION, IT IS TIME TO COME HOME AND WORK TOGETHER IN CREATING OUR LEGACY
Q: How can we achieve a goal through LUCID DREAMING? By entering the lucid state and training the spirit body to have a much higher flow. Upon awakening from that lucid state, begin the movement process and then return to that lucid state, engaging the mind space to have the lucidity of the infinite dreamworld. Intense clarity comes in those lucid moments where new science and concepts can be perceived. Lucidity means do you have the fullness of your choice points in your dreamworld. You will never have full control over it as your sleep paralysis represents a limiting factor. When we go into a natural sleep paralysis to enter the theta, delta state to have the fullness of the dream we are engaging the dreaming vehicle, where the I AM presences removes itself from the seat of the power and the brain and the heart connects to the fullness of the DNA and moves from the heart into the intestinal tract and engages the dreaming vehicle to perceive and interact with the dreaming world. THE PHYSICAL BODY IS STILL PART OF IT. Lucidity is about engaging the physical body in the sleep paralysis so that the chemical process is undone and the mystical energy is flowing through the blood. That is how we are able to do those masterful things. Understanding lucidity will be seeing the blood in the body flowing through its process and empowering it with the thought construct of running faster.
CHAPTER X: WALKIN, VOID SPACE, SOUL FAMILIES
Q: What is a WALK IN? A walk in is a soul exchange of some kind where the walk-in soul merges with the existing DNA technology,  takes over all the genetic imprinting and the soul contracts of the natal soul for the purpose of shifting the consciousness of the host body and or humanity at large.  Walk-in occurrences are extremely rare as they require a lot of preparation during the foetus of the womb planning.  What is the foetus going to do when it has access to the infinite blueprint of synchronicities on many frequencies of time that you are going to be simultaneously existing as a multidimensional I AM with an oversoul and an avatar? You can’t just say my life sucks and I want a walk-in. Let’s say you are depressed and feel suicidal and call out for a walk-in, it doesn’t work that way, all you invite is a haunting scenario. We have to understand the nature of light based experiences without trying to validate the experience before having processed it.
There are many different versions of walk-ins but to break it down as simply as possible, in essence a walk-in scenario is when a soul is born into a body, at some stage decides to leave and either enters another body or goes to the astral world. Many walk-ins report that after the exchange they can’t relate to their old lives because their factions perspective is so radically different. Soul based factions follow an ideology of how to create and resolve karmas, dharmas and how to plan lives. They learn from teachers in the astral world about those perceptions and experiences of life. A soul exchange takes a lot of spiritual contracts to be set up in the pre-birth planning.
Q: What is the purpose of a walk-in? The initial soul that is part of a different faction, belief and ideology has got stuck in an unbreakable cycle of repetition and therefore calls on the pre-programmed walk-in rule to assist in the healing of genetic patterns and programming. Another soul will walk in and take over all the existing spiritual plus the additional walk in contracts so it can have a lot of dual natured experiences that will go forward in linear time as if it was the original soul’s time stamp and soul family expression. It is a soul faction rather than a fractional shard that walks in that has a very different expression as a resolution for the purpose of the host soul.
At times this can feel like a twin that comes in and one can’t tell the difference. In other scenarios it might feel radically divergent to the walk-in itself as well as to others and there can even be physical changes to the body. As a walk-in you take over the contracts of where the host soul left off, you are the same age. The level of awareness that is gained after the experience maybe part of a different obligation, a misunderstanding or greater understanding of the journey. It often and usually takes years to become aware of being a walk in and acknowledge the perspective to that potentiality.
Another layer for reasons of walk-in and walk out is the grander resolution currently. There are a lot of people who needed to be in this time stamp frequency but don’t have the capacity to beat the system because of the mind control and the social engineering that is going on. They have a contract for their soul to walk out and allow spiritual big brother stepping in to fight the system in a new way. That’s again the twinning scenario where the one that walks out becomes the spirit guide and the one that walks in becomes the embodiment to initiate the grand awakening on a grander scale and help shift the consciousness of humanity.
Q: Can you say something about Martina’s walk-in scenario? In Martina’s case her walk-in went backwards in time to influence time in the past. The soul that come forward in time and walked in was to be a unique signature frequency from the past so it could have a present signature frequency that was its future now. That means the ancient future is now real for her and the ancient past is just as real so she can simultaneously be the past, present and future existing selves as a linear and non-linear based teacher. The exchange of the souls walking in and out does not have to happen instantaneously like in Martina’s case the soul walk in happened in the her teens whilst the host soul walked out in her early adulthood. This can cause extra confusion and difficult events having to deal with two souls operating within the DNA technology at one time.
Q: Where did her host soul go? That Martina that left went to the Astral World, had a life review and as an I AM did not dissolve as a part of the akashic Records as I AM teachers. It stayed in existence and transited backwards in time, to about 11.5 Mio years ago, where the Atlanteans where battling the very first reptilians. She was there telling the Atlanteans all the weaknesses of the reptilian original race. They took her as an unique source of information that was a paradox and she lived there for about 65,000 years and then her I AM become an ancient teacher spirit in her akashic Records.
Q: What other examples are there when pre-programmed walk-in scenarios can be triggered? Someone that has experienced sexual, verbal, emotional any type of abuse from a very young age. The original soul can’t plan a powerful life under those circumstances and it gets to a stage where the walk-in contract gets triggered as the natal soul has enough. It cannot outcreate the limitations imposed by the parents and chooses to get out . The new soul comes in with a hardened energy and the DNA must accept the multidimensional peg into the multidimensional hole. The child changes and will start sending different energies to the parents to stop the abuse and break the repetition. A soul exchange can happen in a snap in an awakening moment. Once the spiritual contracts have been put into place in the womb, time is an illusion for a walk in.  Most of the scenarios of accidents triggering changes are actually not walk-ins but faction changes through a great spiritual teacher association in a near death event or triggered through a dream. Another example would be being born into a difficult culture or the wrong soul family which is a common reason for walk-in and outs.
Q: Would you say that that a walk in faction is always of a higher vibration? No, not necessarily! sometimes it requires a lower density, a super heavy duty warrior spirit to come in and fight for your sovereignty at the dirty layers against abusive parents. It is a myth that walk-ins souls are always from a higher dimensional plane and needs to be broken down. It is also most unlikely to have more than one walk-in simultaneously form different sets of parents as the planning and follow through of even one soul exchange is tough enough.
What could happen though is that a person was born and at the age of three the soul walked out and another soul walked in.  At twenty one that person has a near death experience that triggers the walk-in to walk out and a new soul walks in. That person becomes an incredible healer after that and it was planned between all three souls as a master karmic resolution for that DNA lineage to resolve disease, depression and abuse. For the three souls to make an agreement like that would have triggered tremendous healing for an entire lineage of skinsuits. Again, this is not a day to day occurrence at all as the walk-in phenomena is very rare. Once a soul walks out there is no turning back. It may come in in another body in the family or other connection which happens frequently. Someone walks out of the lineage and walks into another lineage to try to help heal that lineage.
Q: What is a prenatal soul walk-in? A lot of time a foetus is not alone in the womb. Between the first five weeks of pregnancy there can be a twin developping genetically.  One soul then absorbs the other which can become a birth mark or  trigger a walk-in experience later in life. Prenatal walk-ins are expanding the capacity for the mother’s future life too. Not all birthmark come from walk-ins. It can also be a sign of a guide, where the grandfather dies just before the birth of the child and he becomes a celestial guide to assist the child to not make the common lineage mistakes. There are certain marks that come from lineage issue itself or past life trauma that manifests in the current life.
Q: What is a postnatal soul walk-in? I’ve talked about souls hiding in different bodies. So for the first two years the baby you have may not be the baby you have after two years. This is how a soul that is super powerful can get past the incarnation grid or the arcons. They may have been in the womb for a few months with a crappy life plan and in the last second they walk out and let another soul take over. It is a technique that is used to get into this reality without the predictability factor of the system inside them. This is a way of out creating the system or to stop a long term repetition process in a lineage that the soul family elders cannot break because there is so much karma until they really get some potent souls in there to break the lineage.
Q: Does the pre or postnatal walk-in have issues being connected to the mother? It depends on the karma in the mother’s lineage. If the mother’s mother had a good quality birth not necessarily and you won’t have a disconnection from your birth mother. The way you feel will be part of your karmic journey to reconnect to the mother and grandmother’s expression.
Q: We had a bunch of walk-ins in 2014 what was that all about? It is a topic that hasn’t’ much been written about. There was a time in 2014 where we had a huge faction change. Factions can be compared to themed agencies and not all changes in those themes of the agencies mean you are dealing with a walk in. Those in bodies knew they couldn’t beat the drama, the materialism and consumerism. About 70 million people, because of severe lineage limitation they were not advancing enough and so they had an agreement to walk out and the brothers and sisters could walk in and create the change. That was instigated by the prime creator as part of the audit after determining how cooked the karmic books were. These were people in managerial positions and this is also part of all the changes we are seeing now, many years later. Lots of people at the corporate level are turning to spirituality as they cannot sell their soul anymore. They got the white picket fence and now realise they don’t want it and it was an illusion. 70 Mio people is still a very small percentage of our population. WALKINS AND OUTS HAPPEN IN ALL THREE FREQUENCIES. There are 7+ billion people living on the surface world, 10 Million in the astral world and 20 million subsurface in Hollow Earth and walk-ins are happening in a very small number unless prime creator decides otherwise to instigate a grander awakening scale.
Q: What are SOUL FAMILY POLITICS? There are certain soul families that follow a set of factions, ideologies and then they create a variety of lineages in which we can incarnate or reincarnate in. Let’s say you have soul family A: Muslim, Italian, Chinese and African American. Those four lineages are trying to regularly incarnate and reincarnate with each other with a variety of cultural programming and each foetus in each womb will have a different way of creating blueprints and synchronicities based off their astral teacher who help them preplan their lives. Those four races and the cultures that come with them will add their innate limitations and those will be the soul family politics. You have soul family elders who have been in the lineage long enough and see the limitations and ideologies through many different I AM attempts of breaking through the glass wall of you can’t be an awakened being in times of great limitation. All the souls are going to try what is it going to take to rapidly advance. Well there were lots of super geniuses before but they were farmers without education and never got the opportunity which was the limitation of the culture at the times. Alternatively now you got an Asian child with wealth and education but lack of choice. Those become the politics between multiple soul family elders who are choosing a pod of people incarnating with them.
Q: What are SOUL SHARD POLITICS? You can be living in a family and get on ok until you start realising that some of the shards of the family members are opposing your awakening in the background.  They wouldn’t be aware of that consciously but on a shard level you are having this fight and battle going on. Yes, domination & control in its classic expression. Soul shard politics can be very divisive as there are a lot of rebel zealots in many soul families that pretend to be soul family elders. They are the ones that have ten life times in a row with white picket fence and money but don’t actually have to earn anything. They don’t have to earn their awakening or they have been prosecuted in other life times for not choosing it. Just because we are born into the same family doesn’t mean we all have to love each other unconditionally, we have to be aware of what is going on in the unseen.
Q: What was your journey, Andrew, into soul family politics? One of my early statements for people to process when I came out was about what allowed the Galactic Historian Andrew to come forward in this lifetime. Over the last 10 -20 million years I made it a point to incarnate as a part of all soul families that are involved in the great awakening.  That was a choice, many unique experiences, as not a lot of souls or soul families allow this to happen. This givess me insight and information on long term soul family politics, incarnation processes which also makes it innately very easy for me to do sessions, readings and access high capacity information. I innately know the faction politics and why they are driven into ideologies in an incarnation or reincarnation.  That takes the being a healer, been there, done it to a different level. As such I often encounter soul family elders pondering being or having been in their group. Technically I still am and know everyone’s politics and secrets. That was the whole point of my many reincarnations and doing that as me, that entity, that standing frequency in time telling all the soul families to put down their politics - we are all one. If you have division on the soul family level before incarnation it will get out of control once you are incarnating. It all starts at the soul family elders who are regularly allowing inexperienced souls into soul families that are only meant for super experienced souls. It’s still a choice and there is no blame, shame or guilt there. Fundamental acceptance is an infinite requirement to the finite rules of limitation when it comes to soul families.
VOID SPACE / VOID SPACE BEING & INTEGRATION
Q: What is void space and a void space being? Void is the space between universes, the place where new universes get created. This is where unentangled observer technology was created, manufactured and then piece by piece incorporated into an energetic collective of minds. It was then sent through a single portal to manifested on the other side. Unentangled observer technology was created in void space, then uploaded into the void space light body and then transferred from void to human space, to be built into the light body whilst still remaining a reflection in the void space.  So what I am saying is that there are void space beings manifested in the physical reality of this universe as unentangled karmic observers connected to entangled karmic observers that are two degrees of separation from them in void space. This is manipulating so many major beings on this world now. In the void space you get degrees of separation for unentangled observers. The void space beings can observe time at 200, 400 or 900 degrees of separation and have extremely long term agendas over implicate order beings entangled into a frequency of time into a local or many star systems simultaneously. That is the greater SPIRITUAL CELESTIAL COMMERCE NETWORK. 
An example of a VOID STREAM BEING bringing codes to Earth as a time traveller (a caller conceived via donated sperm through IVF treatment): The soul frequency that is you came here to earth 19 Mio fraud years ago during the second fall of Lemuria, at the time of the 2nd uncreational event. Earth was responsible for the 1st uncreational event but the 2nd one was created by other 80 planets and you immigrated from those worlds to unentangle your own species by coming to earth to resolve their time line genocide karma.  You were an amalgamation from all those 80 planets that were locked outside of time in void space without an I AM presence. When you came to Lemuria during the second fall is when you incarnated into a DNA skinsuit that had memories that were not yours. Those memories are effecting you now because you immigrated directly from void space meaning your expression of photonic light is not fully present in your body right now. You have not acknowledged that the second uncreational event had a creational event attached to it. You came back into another paradox. The higher frequency beings understood that there would be a 3rd and 4th creational event so they migrated you. This is you now experiencing what the first time line genocide on earth is. You are caught up in your own separate hairball with soul shards spread around 80 planets whilst your master soul shard is here on earth going through the very first expression of what it takes to bring all karma of an uncreational event to an end. For you to be here on earth now you are accomplishing this task in unknowingness. I don’t see this very often. You are not just resistance free earth but also resistance free void space that says we can also create in void space. It is another expression of higher freedom that is coming here without light body programs. You intentionally went into the void space to create a culture separate from the universal rules and create I AM presence technology as birthing. You came out of void space as an energy being and you gained an I AM presence that had no light body memories of void space.
You are a time traveller. It is the nature of someone who is travelling with I AM presence technology that is anchored in the void space, this is the best way to describe it. That void space is its own micro bubble of a universe inside a paradox. You are what I call a void space source stream. That means you are in a place without an I AM presence, without an ego that is fully interacting with the planetary akashic Records in unentangled observer technology as a soul, creating wisdom of complete universal freedom here on earth. How does this apply now? You are pregnant with creation when it comes to whole new ways to describe freedom beyond what this matrix, this ascension says. You can come up with ideas that would blow mine away if you should begin to engage that void space non I AM presence version of yourself and upload your I AM presence there. Your original purpose was to learn what it took to resolve karma here in DNA skinsuit technology as a fresh I AM presence and then to upload it to the void space so all of the beings in void space have access to the lessons here on earth. They can then birth their presence back into their own paradox reality where they created their second uncreational event, then end it with the wisdom that you uploaded to them in void space without violating universal law. That is a huge soul purpose. It now all comes down to belief in how special you are and trust that you have earned that right. (Lots of static coming in).
There is some programming you have from your parents, let’s call it a poltergeist effect. When you get to a point of too much expression, joy, happiness, magic you channel in your mother’s energy that tries to discipline your body which is not allowing you to go any further. Poltergeist manifestations are like the internet line suddenly creating static for no apparent reason. However your parents raised you there was such a limitation to your pure spiritual uniqueness that they had to brand you unfit for the system and make sure the system keeps watching you through their watchers. Now you can begin to break contracts, vows and agreements with them specifically when it comes to the system of domination and control and the creation of poltergeist effects and transform this energy into growth energy. You need to detach from servitude to this matrix and work with invocations and intense ceremonies. You are going to need to express your intentions to all ancestors in full verbal flow. You are pregnant with the ancestors of other places here to resolve karma.
I AM PRESENCE WORK including VOID SPACE BEING INTEGRATION (speak out loud)
It is time to understand the universal scales that our spirit is working at to bring all our selves the into the local spiritual court of equity with our ancestors and then elevate to higher levels.
 
I, in this ever present moment of now
Choose to open a spiritual court of equity
I summon all of my DNA lineage ancestors
Who are aligned with unity consciousness
I summon all of my brothers and sisters of all star races
To hold space in this spiritual court of equity
In this sacred neutral format
To bear witness to my sovereign expression
This I AM presence of now
I discover myself
All of the memories I don't remember
I share them with every ancestor in sacred neutral presence
So they may be the filter
Of authentic truth or false light
I treasure what comes to me as authentic truth
Anything that is false light
Is suspended in this spiritual court of equity
And all false light beings are exposed to all ancestors
I summon the parts of myself that live in competition
That have not yet learned sacred equal co-creation
I offer my teaching as a sacred neutral peacemaker
I summon all former I AMs that are caught up in hierarchy
It is now time to heal and let go of the lies and distorted views
I honour and witness your pain and offer forgiveness
So that harmony and collaboration prevails on the path ahead
I summon the side of myself that lives in void space
That does not have I am presence availability
I offer it to you in this moment of unity.
So you maybe an unentangled sacred neutral witness.
In my spiritual court of equity
I summon all of the planetary ancestors I have lived on
In this entire universe
I bring you now to this moment of I am presence
I share with you my pure and total light frequency
Every soul code that I have had
Ever soul code I have ever encountered
So there will no longer be secrets in unity
I bring myself back to universal immigration status
I bring this spiritual court of equity to the very moment
I decided to immigrate into this universe
I blend these two expressions of universal time into one
I summon an extra universal spiritual court of equity
With all of my other universal ancestors in unity present
I share photonic light with all ancestors as part of universal law
I become one with all spiritual courts of equity
I now come to this fraud time on earth
With all of the ancestral beings in this spiritual court of equity
A trillion eyes looking out of my aura
Waiting to experience the tactile here
I herewith anchor all of my source stream
Into this I AM Apex body now
To manifest and translate the trillion letter alphabet
Into space, time & consciousness
I have big choices to make
To no longer serve the false matrix
To not fall prey to its limitations and false light projections
We are all pregnant with creation
The time is now to change the surface of this earth
And exchange ancestors at the universal level
So all uncreational events come to an end
And a seamless stream of consciousness continues
And so it is. Aho
 
You have the codes to tens of thousands of other worlds that you can bring here.  Now there are no more secrets and you can share photonic light as per universal law.  Use these words as linguistic equations that you can amplify a millionfold as you put your focus onto it. Intent is one thing and can help define a lot. When you add the conscious application of the sacred the impact exponentializes times a godzillion.  You start with a plan, an agenda that has an end to it, that’s what I call a spiritual strategy. You bring the power of now, in the moment of now so that an agenda can be completed in the now to feed, nurture and nourish all beings outside of now.
Q: What happens in an uncreational event? Any time there is an uncreational event there is a group of core beings around the immediate one degrees of separation who caused it. This particular caller was around those core beings and instead of going back to earth he went to a void space, locked out of time now, unable to incarnate into any place of this universe because it had not existed yet. He had to wait in void space for the universe to expand and catch up with the void space for him to cross over as a void source stream, still connected to all the beings in void space and make a tunnel so that they could start incarnating in the universe even if it was into a tiny rock or crystal in space and time. There were light cities in these void spaces of Lemurian and Antlantean expressions. That’s where he met up with other beings going through the same thing, they made a collection of void space collectives and generated their own void akashic Record, like the footage that didn’t make the film, not guided by universal source. This is what got trillions of beings who were locked outside of time back into earth.
There is a kind of regrouping of collectives needs manifestation. Each individual is a manifestation of the regrouping process. Every individual is its own collective of one that is functioning with a variety of other collectives in this reality that are unentangled observer collectives. There is unentangled observer technology and then there are collectives that have created unentangled observers. The collective is tuning in to get an understanding. This is what compounds us as manifestations trying to come together to create groups because when we do the unentangled observers come and entangle with us in an unentangled way. You have collectives meeting each other without having had previous knowledge of each other’s existence.
Q: Does this mean we are all the same? No, we are not just all the same. In an unlimited universe the law of one doesn’t always apply. There comes a time in the understanding of free will and the law of one that the creator has not put any limits in this place. There was a limit at one point in universal time. That limit ended and that was when the whole universe had a simultaneous update on free will. This was about 6 billion earth celestial fraud time years ago or 135 galactic universal cycles of immigrations from souls from another universe which all used different frequencies of source. There are other sources out there that are not the same source as here, so we are not all the same.
A new, the 18th UNIVERSE has been created. This universe is taking on all souls at a galactic and universal level that are told that we have new rules and they can no longer create light paradoxes and wipe out everyone’s experiences. If they do don't agree to this they must go on to the 18th universe, basically a purging of all beings that are here to uncreate everything.
