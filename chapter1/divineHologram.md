Space-time is an infinite set of co-ordinates atop existence. We live in
a reality defined by experience. We tell stories. They have a beginning,
a middle, and an end. We chronicle our stories. The first person who
ever took pen to paper did so in fear, and this is why human beings are
enmeshed in stories. We love the drama. We love to create it, and we
love to consume it. Drama is tension. Human beings say they want peace,
but it's kind of a scam when you're honest. If we wanted peace we
wouldn't create tension in our lives, but without the tension we can't
live the drama. It's best just to be honest. If you lie about it you're
more susceptible to programming, which proliferates the world, hundreds
of broadcast networks and movie studios all over the world &mdash; Hollywood,
Bollywood, Hong Kong, Shanghai, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation,
British Broadcasting Corporation, and too many more to list &mdash; all
servicing humanity's insatiable appetite for programming, which is drama
for the most part, which, as we have clearly established, is tension.
Yet, if you walk up to any human being and ask them if they prefer peace
to tension they will tell you they prefer peace. Isn't that strange?

It really isn't that strange when you understand what's going on down
here. On the spiral ladder of our deoxyribonucleic acid &mdash; DNA by its
affectionate abbreviation &mdash; we hold an evolving marker of our place in
time-space which also represents our level of consciousness. This marker
is the sum of our *experience* &mdash; where experience is movement in
time-space, and the drama, the tension, we create &mdash; and represents but a
faction of our greater soul, and the experiences we have assimilated as
a soul faction.

This marker is directly aligned with our level of responsibility because
our level of consciousness is always equal to our level of
responsibility. They are in a symbiotic relationship, consciousness and
responsibility. DNA is in essence coordinates to where we fit in
space-time, or, to stay with our narrative, how we've been *written
into* the story. Our circumstance is our DNA, which is our story, which
is our tension, which is our drama, which we wrote and act out
ourselves, forgetting the author sleeps in our unconscious.

We have the story, creation, and we have the author, God and soul as a
fractal of God, or the prime creator, as God is so anthropomorphically
programmed into human consciousness as a being like us &mdash; two arms and
legs, two eyes and ears, bipedal, and fond of long white beards &mdash; and we
have the actor, soul as well, incarnate &mdash; sheathed really &mdash; in this
body, borrowed from air, earth, water, fire, and ether.

The travail of the soul is to unlock levels of consciousness. It is a
travail because we must suffer for it. New consciousness permits us to
embody new experiences, to write, direct, and star in a more expanded
story.

So why a hologram, and, more importantly, why a divine hologram? It's a
hologram because it is light projected into a three dimensional
manifestation. It's divine because the light comes from the prime
creator, God. When we use the word hologram we get an idea of something
mechanistic, of some malicious tinker on the other side of reality
making it, and, therefore, it's all fake, a simulation, and therefore we
are the victim of something. Nothing could be further from the truth,
unless we can victimize ourselves, which we can and we do, because drama
needs tension, and tension is stress, and volunteering for stress by
manufactured tension is masochistic. By calling it a hologram, with all
the mechanistic undertone, we make an object of our reality, something
acting against us, a god, a devil, an angel, a demon, anything but
ourselves. This is why we objectify our reality. This is why we call it
a simulation, a matrix, a hologram. It's a lack of consciousness, a
failure to attribute the divine to the light, and a stone deaf ear to
the word, which is the sound which is the light, sustaining all the
worlds in this sound and light manifestation. It's funny, because when
you clue into it; it's everywhere.

    She should have died hereafter.
    There would have been a time for such a word.
    Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow
    Creeps in this petty pace from day to day
    To the last syllable of recorded time.
    And all our yesterdays have lighted fools
    The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle.
    Life’s but a walking shadow, a poor player
    That struts and frets his hour upon the stage,
    And then is heard no more. It is a tale
    Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,
    Signifying nothing.

    Macbeth
    William Shakespeare

Why would the end of time be marked and measured by syllables? Because
it's all sound, and light is a form of sound. This is, of course, why we
have so much tonal prayer and trance, whether it be Sufi dervishes
spinning to an intoxicating Arabic song-like prayer, heavy on chanting,
the persistence of mantra in yoga and meditation, long vowel sounds
drawn out on the breath, or the deep throat singing of the Mongols,
which, they say, allows them to speak to their ancestors, and Gregorian
chanting in the Christian tradition. It's all about the sounds.

There are so many creation stories. The garden of Eden and the rather
horrid unfolding of Genesis, the incredible tales of the turtle universe
from the Iroquois Confederacy in Canada, or the novel, post-modern
*school room of soul* narrative the new age favors. They're all versions
of the same story. One of the more recent &mdash; only five hundred years ago
&mdash; is the Anurag Sagar, orated by an illiterate weaver named Kabir Sahib,
a satguru &mdash; which means *true teacher* &mdash; of his time. He ups the game
big time. He introduces a creation story where God willed everything
into existence with seventeen shabdas &mdash; sound currents &mdash; that animate
all the dimensions and sub-dimensions that weave together reality. It's
an incredibly precise addition to creation mythologies, and certainly
the forebearer of all notions of at least a great many of our dimensions
being simulations of sorts. Hence the divine hologram, which is the
metaphor for creation used here, in this instance, a literal metaphor.
It's true both figuratively and literally. The seventeen shabdas
originate from a place that itself has no sound, but is not silent, and
no light, but is not dark, the final riddle from the illiterate weaver.

We are not actuality creating anything in time. We are traversing it and
enjoining an experience with it. We are seedlings in a cosmic garden,
passing through experiences expressed in a specific form of life, and
then, when sentience is achieved alongside language and culture, we go
through any number of human expressions until we master the tool, the
*hu man* form, a rather extraordinary instrument, as maligned as it has
become in the *First World*, the newer, better *hu man* that seems just
around the corner, the *trans hu man*, the super man made from man,
Nietzsche's bastard let loose upon the world &mdash; nonetheless, a rather
extraordinary instrument, the *hu man* form. We are inside a sound and
light reality, one of many, and we traverse and enjoin experience with
it, unaware we're inside it, until, by epiphany, the nature of the
system reveals itself in form. The story was written before we lived it,
even though it seemed like it was really happening for the longest of
times. We are living the mapped out keys of the experiences. Every
choice, path, and set of functions, every different type of life has
been made available to us so we can embody the experience, mapped like a
script, written into what we perceive to be a timeline, a bloodline, a
clan, a tribe, a culture, a people, a place, a planet &mdash; stories within
stories, managed by cosmic editors and keepers of time, all under a
prime creator, an amorphous but fully conscious presence in everything
we call life, unconditionally offering the experiences as an expression
of its love. You believe as much already if you follow a prophetic
religion. The prophets tell of a a story already written.

Do not diminish your position as a living and sentient being. You are
creating within this world. Your free will choices unfold the story. As
the story unfolds, you receive the blessings of the particular
experience. Never feel overwhelmed or helpless. We are truly connected
to the outcome of our unique choices. As we get further into this
journey, we realize we're time traveling beings by nature. In no way is
this experience linear. We are responsible for our creations forwards
and backwards in time, and we can make alterations as we see fit &mdash; when
our consciousness is so unfolded &mdash; by connecting to past and future
versions of ourselves.

Eternity is in the present moment, mediated through attention and
awareness, by perception and perspective, until we leave the celestial
sphere, then, a new swath of perception opens. The outer frequency of
this hologram unfolds into more and bigger holograms. This goes all the
way up the scale of our awareness. Our perception allows us a greater,
360 ° view. Suddenly perspective has no direction, no horizon, no fade
to black. It's everywhere, operating at a higher law of nature, but
natural nonetheless. We are unentangled.
