## Free Will, Choice, Consciousness & The Levels of Awareness


The global narrative as we know it today was created at the dawn of
industrialization 300 years ago. It was created so electromagnetic
belief engines could override faith and become a programmed norm. They
needed to get people into cities as slave labor for industrial
production lines. The slaves created and empowered the collective belief
system. People lived in their own bubbles of reality prior to this urban
amalgamation. They had space, and they lived a few hundred kilometers
apart and had their own unique narrative maintained by the chief,
sheriff, or community council. Secret societies proliferated so people
could have their own narrative among followers and believers. The
writers of the global narrative understood they needed to inspire awe,
and they knew they could do it with trains, automobiles, electricity,
indoor plumbing, hot and cold water, refrigeration, telephones. By the
twenties people were living in wooden, stone, or brick houses that
needed heating. In a century and a quarter electricity was in homes.
People no longer needed whale fat for candles and oil. Understand how
monumental this was &mdash; ninety percent of the world was lit by whale fat
for millennia. The narrative had to be updated, revised, and maintained
from one generation to the next to suppress anything that wasn’t fitting
into the official story. This touches almost every science, but, by way
of example let's use anthropology and the hiding of giant’s skulls and
bones. Yes, giants were on the earth. The enforcement of the lies has
been an ongoing control policy right up till today.

We can understand the importance of individual awakening in this time of
collective narrative dominance. The individual needs to dismantle the
global narrative. This is underway in great measure now. This is why the
collective is fracturing, polarized to radically disparate camps, each
with belief systems that leave only insanity as the explanation for the
other side. The desire to change the global narrative is the last part
of the zealot rebel within us who wants to shake everyone awake, even,
unfortunately for the zealots, the ones who aren't ready. We can't force
people to have an experience for which they're not ready. This is an
individual awakening journey, one at a time, in the time the individual
needs. Forcing it violates the free will contract.

We are photonic light beings animated by a non-localized soul which
powers the body. We have consciousness in the body which perceives this
holographic reality in light and memories within shared reality rules.
We are free willed, encoded beings of light, functioning in many
different worlds simultaneously. Everything is synchronistic with the
celestial minds holding space for us. This *I am* being manifested in
this density is mutually co-creating with our higher self, and we are
the *boots on the ground* in a localized space time event. Our memories
are stored in light, and we share those memories within this hologram of
light and sovereign space of power. The heart is the first organ that
develops in the mother’s womb, and it is from this heart space we learn
to redefine our reality rules.

We can freely change the plans we had pre-birth. Everything is based off
the perspective of the observer. Ten years ago, the esoteric side in the
global narrative tried to predict our future based on the data they'd
collected on us. A decade later and they can barely predict ten to
fifteen days ahead. Governments are more transparent now. A veil has
been lifted. They are not incompetent. They are not well intentioned but
poor at execution. They are vile, diametrically opposite their projected
personas. How did we miss that? As a free willed being of choice we can
change the bubble of reality we live in. We can now start seeing the
duality we had tacitly consented to before. This is not a global
awakening. It's an individual journey to exit the heavily militarized
factions that beleaguer our knowingness and hinder our birth right of
being a free willed celestial beings. The future rests in people who get
back to a natural way of living. Stop waiting for them to give us
something. We can walk away from the cities any time. It just takes the
courage to live sovereign.

Consciousness expresses itself through the many choices we make. It has
an unconscious state too. Our bodies have zeros and ones created as
binary numbers for knowing and not knowing &mdash; instinct. It stays in place
until we can decode the information around us. Consciousness is
self-regulating. It presents choice equal to the level of
responsibility, which is a measure of the consciousness, as awareness
and responsibility are in a symbiotic relationship, each nurturing and
growing the other. We live stories we choose to consecrate life and its
purpose, growth of consciousness. Many people try to jump ahead and be
responsible for things they're not even aware of yet. This is a mistake.
Make the decisions that are yours to make for the expansion of your
awareness. Choice is foundational to consciousness.

Each person must ask themselves what the mechanics are behind their
choices. Which choices created a timeline of choices. Each choice and
sub-choice within a set of choice points creates a subconscious map of
*adherence of choices* which helps define our reality. This reality is
all of our choice points combined into the ever present now.

We give form to consciousness &mdash; words, metaphors, concepts, images,
architecture &mdash; which eventually manifests in reality. Our thought
constructs create perceptions which assist people to see all potentials.
The universe has lifeforms existing in one and two dimensions and
densities which are harvested by wisdom, love, and inspiration. They are
expressed in this three dimensional reality for experience in the fourth
dimension and beyond. We continuously expand and add to the divine
hologram through free willed creation. This is our co-creator role.
Every era of light we go through advances souls to other universes and
solar systems when they graduate. We move from one divine hologram to
another, each with a different learning level. This has been perfected
on planet earth, which is a genetic farm outside of the divine intent, a
genetic farm created for commercial not creational purposes. Earth is a
seventy-five percent old soul community, with a steady influx of
twenty-five percent of new souls. The ratio has been in existence for an
extremely long period of time. There are always new souls coming in from
the different galactic life form nurseries. They get a light body, and
they extend their first set of contracts to a planet and a solar system,
which determines the field of consciousness at which they start. Do they
start in the sea of consciousness or the ocean of awareness.

What would be the first life experience &mdash; living in a tunnel in South
America circa two million years ago, praying to a false god. This
process is being replicated on millions of worlds for millions of
different life forms. This is the nature of consciousness. With
evolution come questions &mdash; rights, duties, responsibilities &mdash; to focus
our intention on direct manifestations, to add to the holographic
experiences. Right now there are different levels of background
consciousness around us &mdash; the house you live in has its own relative
consciousness from the building material, the wood, the concrete, the
people that invested their consciousness in building it, the trees that
surround it, the piece of land you're on, the micro-organisms,
squirrels, cats, and dogs &mdash; all of which has a conscious energy field
with its specific spiritual contracts, guides, and guardians. It's all
an apparatus to allow ascension and descension through the different
individual layers of the divine hologram. This animated matter we are
entangling with is part of the fabric of the hologram, linked and
dynamically transformed through the interaction between humans and
microorganisms.

Consciousness is intrinsically spiritual. Part of spirituality is to
acknowledge and become aware of other consciousness surrounding,
interacting, and sharing with us. You can be alone in the house and
still have that experience of consciousness sharing and entangling.
You're never truly alone. DNA can be its own evolutionary impulse which
influences consciousness when experiencing stagnation. A master waveform
operates at a much longer length of time. Within that waveform are all
the individual sub-carriers &mdash; entangled observers &mdash; of that era, that
light, that time. The celestial mind is operating on a much longer and
expansive view of time and timelessness.
