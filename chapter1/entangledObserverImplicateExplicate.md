## Entangled Observer in the Implicate & Explicate Order


As we move past a subject, part of our brain continues to color in the
past event, as if it were a live memory, until we completely disentangle
from the subject. We do it all the time, so much we don't even notice
we're doing it. We go to a party. We have a good time. We synchronize
with the moment. Upon leaving, the energy of the party persists in us
with a kind of half-life &mdash; still thinking and feeling the fun we had at
the party and *coloring* the memory until our consciousness disentangles
from the energetic imprint.

We want to stay with high frequency experiences, but we get disconnected
&mdash; how and why? Sleep can disconnect us. An argument with a significant
other can alter our frequency, but, even a few hours after the argument,
it was still a fun party. Think of a kite and the wind that suddenly
reconnects to the energy. Having a jarring accident could put a sudden
end to a high frequency.\
Then, the next month’s party at the same place has us coloring the
experience before we even get there. We send our precognitive workforce
there to experience it prior to the actual event.

Our state of perception influences us. When we *think back on* the party
we are in the *implicate*, *enfolded order*, as opposed to being *at the
party*, where we are in the *explicate*, *unfolded order*. The state of
perception &mdash; implicate or explicate &mdash; determines how we perceive the
physics of the environment. The physics of the environment, as well as
the observer’s perception, changes as the observer moves between
explicate to implicate order. The state of perception equals
perspective. The perspective of the explicate order &mdash; when you are at
the party &mdash; is different than the perspective of the implicate, the
memory. No matter if you are spiritual, atheistic, or anything else,
it's all quantum mechanics expressed in different words.

The entangled observer uses a deeper information process, while, with
the unentangled observer, the information is in full flow, and there is
no need to process it &mdash; it's already in their knowing. When you have
infinite love co-creating with you, you must truly choose to be the
disentangled observer. Go into your heart space. Create that vision in
your mind and engage with the sacred, neutral observer, knowing
information cannot change you unless you agree to it. Based on how the I
AM now is understood and processed, it will either expand or contract
your knowing. By making that sovereign choice to be the disentangled
observer of the self means you get the fullest versions of yourself in
the here and now. You are the apex of your own hierarchical order. Say that in your mental
heart space.

*I am the apex of my own hierarchical order, and no other hierarchical
system has control and domination within me.* The entangled observer,
going through the process of perception and perspective, is refining the
thought structures. Every time you have an *aha* moment you go from
implicate to explicate. You can be an implicate unentangled observer and
be in the explicate observation simultaneously, but entanglement is a
deeper choice to enter into it.

In this reality there are no real truths and facts because every time we
go from implicate to explicate and back the memory has changed. This is
what shatters space-time as the foundation of everything and creates
plasticity of reality. Consciousness does not adhere to space-time per
the rules of Newtonian physics. Why would it? Consciousness is not of
matter, but it can exist within and experience matter. Thoughts and
memories, even as part of the implicate and explicate order, are a
chemical frequency in nature. There comes a point in light frequencies
where we bypass the chemical frequency in nature, and we operate in a
higher dimension where space and time are no longer relevant. Space-time
is dependent on how the implicate and explicate order goes to chemical
and light memory storage long term. This is when the DNA instrument of
experience can have a 360 ° view of itself. Spiritual contracts can
become part of the implicate and explicate order. This creates the time
stamp on the linear side of the life form, or, the DNA instrument of
experience. It also creates the adherence to the global narrative. The
past, present, and future are irrelevant based off perception, but it is
perception that gives it relevancy in the moment when the chemical
memory becomes a light memory or in the case of high frequency, when we
bypass chemical memories to create an experience.

The status of entanglement determines the outcome. Quantum physics works
on the premise that everything is entangled. It places all significance
on the observer without looking at the observer status of entanglement.

An unentangled observer can observe the quantum field without having an
effect on it. It happens all the time. Observers are born into human
form, sent into this world to create a record of it they then take back
to where they came from. They do not interfere with the unfoldment of
circumstance here. If they did, they would be entangled. There are
numerous observers and collectives of observers that we might call
off-world, able to observe us nonetheless. They are not influencing us,
but they have a perception of us based on the observed data that is put
back into their form of experience &mdash; their body, if you will. like the
human form for us &mdash; or what we can call, however *clinical*, the DNA
instrument. The experience is taken in as a flow, then perceived after
the time of observation. This allows them to remain unentangled
observers because they are two degrees of separation from the original
observance. The DNA does not influence the observation because of the
two degrees of observation from the observed. It is our birth right and
legacy as human beings to do that too. The more degrees of separation
the easier it is to become a quantum observer. As you untangle yourself
from everything that will give you the choice to perceive from a place
of non-definition. DNA has a light frequency in it beyond our
understanding. Our consciousness can engage the unseen world and by
using mystical linguistics our knowing can expand. As unentangled
observer, no charge, no polarity can influence you. You have the
unlimited point of view, in sacred neutrality where all information
flows as an experience in expansion of your knowing. This is when the
mystical becomes the norm.

An unentangled observer may be implicate and explicate at the same time.
You don’t have to have an explicate explanation as a prerequisite to the
implicate order. Every time the quantum field is accessed and observed,
the access and observation creates a marker point in time and no-time
that the implicate and explicate order is no longer defined separately
but viewed simultaneously. You can call back all marker points in time
to which you are a fixed point in space-time for spiritual resolution.
When you become a fixed moment in space-time all of your simultaneously
existing selves can tune into your finite point in time. Those
particular marker points in time could be many eras of light apart, or
the could represent a marker point in an era of light in which you
became an apex of your DNA lineage of registry. You could liken it to
puberty &mdash; that would be a marker point in time. The era of innocence
ends. The adult with miles to go before it sleeps, and promises to keep,
to borrow from Robert Frost, emerges. It’s a marker point in time,
because a greater form of time stamping is created.

Sound is a form of light. Light makes up memories. Memories can be
changed. Yes &mdash; memories can change. We can change our memories. We can
change our past. This is the power given to every one of us, but few
access it it a lifetime. It's just another forgotten part of the grand
being we call soul.

The study of mnemonics is incorrect. The scientists understand the
chemical part of memory, but not the light part. Past, present, or
future memories are all frequencies of light. When we watch a video it
is a slice of time. When we create a document, or read out loud with
power, these are slices of time &mdash; we gather and form intent and imprint
in us that has borders and boundaries to not allow beings of forced
evolution into your frequency. *It enforces the borders and boundaries
saying: I am a match for global dreamtime awakening; I am a signature
frequency match for my own dreaming self; I am a match for my own
healing and mastery; I am a match for union and communion; I am not a
match for hate and war; I am not a signature frequency match for bad
relationships in my life.*

This is what these revocations are for and if you read them from the
heart, from a place of power, expanding the wholeness that is you,
bringing the fullness of your sacred discipline, your sacred genius to
mean what you say. Read them out loud as often as you can. Once you have
found the power in your voice, record them. Listen is a deep meditative
state. Hear your own version of power. Present your own signature
frequency to that past incarnation of you and raise that frequency, that
emanation of light, through sacred discipline and choice. These are
choice points, markers in time. They project to a future version of
yourself who may not be in that power or ready to get to the next level.
Introduce yourself to yourself with this method and you begin to learn
you are your greatest teacher, you are a signature frequency match for
what you focus on. You are a match for great change when it has potent
concepts behind it that directly connect to you. By way of these tools,
powerfully applied in the physical present moment, we make a conscious
choice to be the unentangled observer, to interpret more data and data
sets at a superluminal thinking level, enforcing our sovereignty as
divine co-creative celestial beings of the now.

The unentangled observer is not attached to information or its flow.
Until we become the unentangled observer, we impact on situations purely
through observation. We create another neutral observer external to us
after this. We create it inside the divine hologram. We raise our light
frequency to create that anima part, reaching towards the celestial
medium journey, increasing our frequency until we are the celestial
medium. This hasn’t manifested in the human information field yet.
Nobody in science or spirituality is talking about it.

One might very easily have questions about judgment here. How do you
participate in family, community, economy, government, and world affairs
as an unentangled observer? Suspend judgment. Judgment is an attachment
to this divine hologram we are born into. It's also a petition for
experience. This is our unconscious understanding of irony. In order to
detach we need to practice the unentangled observer. We can achieve a
non-judgmental state, non-competition, equal co-creation, with
non-hierarchical order. It is our natural state.

Judgment is a very unique perspective. There are certain high states of
awareness that use judgment. Judgment is an ongoing challenge all
consciousness is going through. Making something absolute is necessary
to solidify concepts, but it can prevent greater states of awareness.
Judgment is required to materialize concepts from the sea of awareness.
This is another way of looking at materialism. It's not all just cash
and cupidity. There are certain highly aware beings who are very
judgmental. They've gone so far into concepts of good or bad it's their
way or no way.
