# Human Beings


## Mind Heart Gut

There are three parts of a human being which give us information.
the mind,
the heart,
and the gut.
We say these things all the time but don't really understand how literal they are.
We say,
when asked how we know something,
*gut.*
Everybody knows what we mean,
and they also know that it's not empirical.
It's a kind of instinct and intuition.

The heart is much more verbose in the human record.
We attribute the heart to conscience,
moral direction,
and the love of God,
the prime creator.


>You have no part or portion in this matter, for your heart is not right before God.

>Acts 8:21

The heart is one of the most powerful receivers in the human system,
and its proper functioning opens up higher communication from the light worlds.
It is in many ways a passage between the chemical and light experiences.
Our hearts tell us when we're in love,
when we're not in love,
when we are at peace,
and when we are not at peace.
Many forms of addiction are the result of not wanting to deal with the heart,
of distilling some feeling of betrayal,
or of allowing a trauma to dominate the heart.

The mind is the information processing center as well as a very powerful receiver itself.
It is the easiest part of a human being to trick,
control,
program,
or destroy.
The human mind is a fractal of the universal mind,
which is all knowledge,
as the heart is a fractal of the universal heart,
which is unconditional love,
and the gut is individual to us except for a network of conscious beings explained in this section.
When the three parts work together a nearly perfect human information system is operating.



Sometimes the mind processes better than the heart,
or the gut,
or the other way round.
Then there are certain pieces of information where the mind,
the heart,
and the gut have to work together.
Once the mind-heart-gut starts working together,
the analogical side of the mind
&mdash;
which compares two things
&mdash;
gets stronger,
along with the empowered programs that are with it.
This is why daily practice is so important.
Locality and non-locality are still based off the brain’s time-space location,
which is a marker signifying an anima of awareness and a flow of data.
We use the brain to interpret inter-dimensional frequencies of the multiple versions of self.
The brain is the instrument of experience.
It has a gut-brain and a heart-brain,
each with its own observance/
This allows processing of different time or no-time.
Brain,
mind,
heart,
and gut space are different natures of experience combined into one experience.

DNA communicates within the physical form.
It communicates from form to form through incarnations.
It communicates between incarnations.
It communicates to our light bodies.
It has the ability to go from chemical to light.
This understanding allows reasoned contemplation on many consequence theologies,
the wages of sin,
the sins of the father,
and karma itself,
whether applied to an individual,
a family,
a community,
a geography,
or any other distribution point;
it's all one DNA communication network,
the prime creator's backbone for several layers of experience,
straddling light and chemical,
which correlates to the physical body and the light body.
We are simultaneously living *I am* versions of ourselves,
scattered through time.
In low consciousness these other selves are unrecognized.
To quote Roy Batty from *Blade Runner*:
like *tears in the rain*.
In higher consciousness,
our awareness permits communication to multiple selves,
the consciousness of the earth itself,
and beyond.


The *I am*,
as the incarnate life form,
occupies and entangles consciousness within the body through three stages.
One,
the consciousness is in the brain-heart-gut.
The brain-heart-gut complex links to the central nervous system.
The central nervous system connects the entire fascia system through the vagus nerve
&mdash;
the central nervous system connector
&mdash;
as part of the DNA communication system.
Two,
consciousness is in the sympathetic nervous system (SN) and the parasympathetic nervous system (PSN).
Three,
consciousness is in the entire neural pathway network,
fascia,
dermis,
hairs,
the entire system.
It connects to the gallbladder which is intraconnected to the vagus nerve.
Every organ is intraconnected and interconnected to the vagus nerve.

The life form is part of the individual and collective experience.
Our life forms are on all different levels of awareness
&mdash;
planetary,
solar,
galactic,
and universal.
Contemplate the vagus nerve aligned to our magnetic North and South Pole.
The sympathetic and parasympathetic is our local space time.
The sympathetic drives our daily actions when the soul is in the body.
The parasympathetic drives the body in lucid dreaming and other spiritual states,
or when it is fully in self-defeating programs.
The sympathetic can also be self-defeating and kick the spirit out of the body.
It's driven to resolves karma.
It guides us like a compass to choose a variety of karma out of free will.
The vagus nerve is connecting to the North Pole,
our ancestors,
and to the South Pole,
our future generations.
We need to reclaim the vagus nerve as the truest spiritual sovereign authority we have.
Parasympathetic and sympathetic programs can kick us out of the body.
A sympathetic example would be road rage,
rebellious energy for the most part.
When the parasympathetic takes over and thinks it is the soul the ego and the shadow have made an alliance inside each other to manifest an internal villain,
a bully,
so the soul can’t be in the body.
In Jung’s psychology the subconscious looks upon the sympathetic as fight,
flight,
or freeze,
and it looks upon the parasympathetic as rest,
digest,
and relax.

Entanglement is the measure of how much consciousness is in control of the body.
It is measured through the vagus nerve,
the sympathetic nervous system,
and the parasympathetic nervous system.

The subconscious rest,
digest,
and relax vagus nerve connection is when we are in those spiritual moments where we are reclaiming our authority,
taking back our power and purging the vagus nerve.
Once we fully occupy the central vagus nerve with our consciousness,
we can flow it directly into the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system.
This is how the incarnate life form can retain lucid dream creations.
This explains why people run by programs have difficulty lucid dreaming.
It's difficult to make rich,
high quality memories.
The vagus nerve and the parasympathetic are connected to mystical experiences.
The sympathetic has neural pathways designed to use the five senses.
The five senses sum to the sixth sense,
the totality of the experience.

Think of a violin.
The parasympathetic system is the body of the violin.
The sympathetic system is analogous to the strings on the violin.
The vagus nerve is the bow.
Consciousness plays the violin.
The consciousness of the earth itself is the conductor.
The parasympathetic system is the resonance chamber.
These things are useless alone.
The string is nothing without the bow.
The vibration is nothing without the hollow chamber resonating with the body of the violin.
The fine tuning relates to how much the soul is in the body.

The consciousness of the planet is the conductor.
It hands out the sheet music,
the larger composition to which the individual instruments contribute
&mdash;
the blueprint of synchronicities.
Returning to our linear ocean of awareness metaphor,
the planet is the interconnection so the body
&mdash;
the life form
&mdash;
can have an intra experience with the planet.
This may be alone,
with individual family members,
cultures,
religions,
anything in the sheet music provided by the consciousness of the planet.
In this orchestration we seek harmony to make direct signature frequency matches.
The planet simultaneously exists in the ocean of awareness and the sea of consciousness.
The planet’s celestial mind is the medium between these two levels of awareness as well as the planet itself manifested in time and space so that beings living inside it can have a s set of unique experiences.
This applies to every planet in the universe,
with only a few exceptions.
The celestial mind of the planet is intraconnected with the celestial mind of us,
the life forms,
as well as intra connected with the ocean of awareness and the sea of consciousness manifesting in physical and non-physical space.

We want vagus nerve,
sympathetic,
and parasympathetic sovereignty.
This permits intra and interconnection to our celestial minds.
The journey is in maintaining sovereign connection as an ongoing experience until the experience is second nature.
At this unfoldment we can achieve other forms of embodiment.
We can leave the body and not lose control of the three aspects of consciousness entanglement.
We can create versions of ourselves in other places,
spaces,
and times.
This is our legacy as multidimensional and multi-functional beings.
We can adapt form to communicate with other places,
spaces,
and species.
Sovereignty is earned when the soul can leave at will.
DNA was designed so when we reach a certain frequency we are no longer solely within chemical experience.
Chemical exchanges are fundamental to the life forms living in this third density.
Our journey is from chemical to light.
The water
&mdash;
the fluids
&mdash;
that comprise the atoms of our bodies become a resonant amplifier.
Light based experiences happen through the refraction of water.
The soul is the light inside the body.
The water and fluid are refracting it by chemical reaction.
When we shine light through water or a prism there is no chemical separation of the prism of light.
Thoughts can be implicate and explicate at the same time
&mdash;
orgasmic experiences,
love,
and fundamental experience without thought.


Reincarnation was a trap that created karmic entanglements.
To get back to celestial mediumship,
reincarnations are optional and free willed for karmic resolution.
We achieve multidimensional living and realize leaving here was never truly the goal.
Multidimensional existence is the goal.
We can generate a part of ourselves that continues the journey while having many other parts of ourselves in other places.
The *I am* apex presence roots uncontested in the here and now.
Reincarnation and some forms of incarnation became competitive reduction journeys.
The entire experience of death is set to change.
Our lives will go to three hundred years,
five hundred,
seven hundred years in one go.
The passing over experience will persist to finish this era of light’s karmic accounts.
Our capacity to plan future lives with twenty to thirty percent of our life memories,
hundreds of millions of years as our database for mapping future lives.


We're not put on our mother’s heart for days after birth with the umbilical cord connected.
This is the natural law of harmony.
It's so simple the slightest sophistry devolves us of spiritual inheritance.
Birthing in hospitals with *licensed* medical personnel and limited bed time due to economies of utility does not complete the first synchronizing of the child.
Our *I am* technology has to come out quickly in our body in the present system.
Everything is set to slow down.
The future will see more natural birthing.
Pregnancy will be between nine and twenty-five months.


There are children here now with a good part of their memory available to them.
They might be ahead of time and lack parental guidance.
The fetus in the womb planning is set to change as well.
The mother and father will co-plan the spirit journey before the fetus even enters the womb.
It will be light based planning from the outset while fully incarnate in this third density.
This is multidimensional living.
This is the great leap forward,
no offense to Mao Zedong.
He had the concept right.
It was the context he lacked.
A whole new human race is ready to step out of the chrysalis of time and spread its magnificent and colorful wings.
This is the promise.



## Fertility and Spirituality


There's an eye in the heart often activated through child birth.
Women can see through this eye in the same manner we see through the third eye in the forehead,
the imagination center.
The menstrual cycle is a way for the rods and cones to align with the third eye plus the ones in the heart,
rectum,
or clitoris,
all extensions of the third eye.
A man’s third eye can travel to the tip of the penis and connect into the womb portal from there.
Menstrual cramps and pains are often a sign of being out of alignment in those areas.
A most beneficial prayer technique for women during their cycle is to call in all their thoughts,
ideas,
constructs,
and energies from previous menstruation cycles and detach from them on a month to month basis.
These powerful times for women are being high jacked and bastardized by the global narrative.
The menstrual blood is very powerful as an energy of being a negotiator,
an arbitrator,
or peacemaker.


Menstruation continues after menopause.
Women still go through the cycle without blood.
The fertility spirits attached to menopause move on to a higher density.
The DNA is no longer producing the unique experience of bleeding,
but the spiritual mechanics remain the same,
even more intensified through menopause.
In most cases when women experience heavy menopausal symptoms,
they're actually giving birth in other simultaneous realities which need the births.
Their remaining fertile life alters versions of themselves who didn’t get pregnant.
Using their biological clock,
they find a signature frequency match to complete interdimensional birthing as part of their karmic resolution.



Hot flashes can happen when an alternate version of the woman is breaking water and is more than likely going to die from the birth.
they are transferring chemical life force based on their experience to avoid this.
A hot flash can also be another version of us,
in another place and time,
and in an alien form,
in which the birth got difficult.
Birthing is part of karmic resolution.
This is important to remember.
Through strands of awareness in the DNA,
the connective tissues transfer life force to assist in that birth by another simultaneous version of ourselves who lacks fertility power or lives in an environment with no fertility at all.
This allows the mystical births to happen,
the babies who should never have survived or lived.
Evening primrose oil is one of the natural remedies for hot flashes.
This plant oil is harvested as an essence to lessen the effect in this reality and,
at the same time,
it amplifies the experience on the unseen side.



Some strands in the DNA need a special chemical soup in the body to activate fertility.
It used to be manipulated in the overall chemistry of the body.
Other strands had more opportunities to awaken.
When a woman who never gave birth is going through a very difficult time during menopause,
another version of her simultaneous existence is going through a birthing experience.
They are both be intrinsically linked to reduce the negative effect.
There are times when co-living souls go through menopause together,
This generates new life in celestial nurseries.
It gives birth to a new soul frequency in the ocean of awareness.
The new soul frequency begins the journey into the sea of consciousness and manifests in time and space.

The fatty deposits around the midline during menopause serve as a protective membrane,
but it can block good experiences with regards to working with a woman’s residual image.
Once the biological fertility clock stops ticking,
the *awareness clock* takes over.
We can gain a greater awareness and perspective of the awakening.
We can experience mood swings when the body is trying to find the right chemistry.
It's a balance between overproducing and underproducing hormones and chemicals.


Men go through menopause too,
and they also have their individual process through cycles of creation.
As they actualize their physical manifestations,
a house,
artwork,
business,
what have you,
they leave their legacy for their clan,
tribe,
nation.
Men build an archive of experience that stays manifested in time and space.
Lineages in the unseen can plan lives through the infrastructure created by the urge of manifestation.
Men reach their sexual peak around the age of eighteen.
Women reach their peak in their thirties.
This is why it's important for the infrastructure in the unseen to be planned.
The cycles have been manipulated by DNA farming.
If the human reproductive cycle was not manipulated,
most pregnancies would be eighteen to twenty-four months.
In some instances it can be up to five years.
In the past,
the umbilical cord wouldn’t be cut for months.
This allowed more bonding between the partners.
There was more opportunity for the father to have ritual connection to the child through the mother as the medium of the connection.

Testosterone drives creativity in men.
There are other things similar to testosterone that drive construction.
A male scientist doesn’t use testosterone,
but he uses another version of it,
a mental aspect of the testosterone.
There's no scientific name for it yet in this reality.
There are several hundred forms of testosterone,
each with a different chemical chain that allows a different aspect of creation.
Through manipulation of our bodies we are not producing the all encompassing testosterone which keeps us in fight,
flight,
or freeze.
Our glands have been manipulated to produce one strand of testosterone over the other which leads us back to the cerebellum in the motor cortex.



The birth control pill is manufactured from giant farms of female horses.
The urine of a pregnant horse is the chemical basis of the birth control pill.
The horses are pregnant their entire life.
Their colts are taken and chopped up into horse meat sold to pet food manufacturers and fast food restaurants.
The entire industry revolves around the urine of pregnant horses for human birth control pills.
Many women reject the different types of pills.
There's a malaise associated with the pill they can feel.
They become worse and worse until they get the birth control pill out of their lives.
Before the horse urine birth control pill there were plenty of natural herbal remedies to stop pregnancy.
Like most lineage medicine
&mdash;
Ayurveda,
traditional Chinese medicine,
homeopathy,
naturopathy,
and others
&mdash;
it was delegitimized and marginalized by the big allopathic medical footprint that coincided with the big push into the twentieth century economy,
in which everything was patented,
synthetically replicated,
restricted to *licensed* practitioners,
taxed
and brought into the mercantile system.

## Karma


It's very easy to create karma through unawareness.
It's really the purpose of karma.
Karma is unawareness.
The karmic cycle produces awareness.
Karma is the simplest of things to understand once we build into the divine hologram.
It begins in our vaguest of awareness,
a silent petition,
a nudge for experience,
then,
somewhere in time we meet the circumstance that matches the silent petition.
We sign the contract and we cycle through the karma.
We live the experience,
first as an inner realization of what the impulse was,
then the manifestation,
then the realization and participation of others drawn to the karmic circumstance we have created,
as we will be drawn to others in an effort to resolve our karma,
and then the co-creator edits our creation in the form of,
you guessed it,
karma.



All of it is tied together by this sound and light that animates all the worlds where we create.
I suppose a canvas would be an appropriate metaphor.
We are an aspect of that which generates the sound and light.
We are an aspect of the prime creator.
We can co-create in the divine hologram.
It's all a co-creation down here,
at least insofar as human beings are concerned.
But we own what we create through cycles and consequences we didn't anticipate when we created.
This is the law.
Own what we think,
feel,
and do.
Of course the law is oft abused and circumvented.
Karma dumping and swapping
&mdash;
read scapegoating here
&mdash;
is an active market for third party consultants:
ritualists,
black magicians,
wizards,
artificial intelligences,
influential entities,
and too many more to list here.


Let's take a simple,
commonly experienced karmic pattern in our post-modern human life
&mdash;
the dysfunctional relationship.
Remember the last time we were in one.
Now remember when we allowed ourselves to contemplate leaving the relationship.
We felt elated,
right?
It was a mixture of fear,
elation,
and tension.
Our precognitive workforce foreshadowed our emotional state.
That's how we were able to feel it.
We borrowed emotions from an as-of-then unlived future.

It's possible to have a parallel set of experiences.
There can be two parallel and simultaneous expressions of us existing at decision points.
The simultaneously existing *I am* chooses to walk out,
but we don’t,
or vice versa.
It makes no difference.
There's an infinite number of reasons why parallel cross overs happen.
It balances out the old karmic journey and creates a new one
&mdash;
the law of entanglement.


The great awakening transcends karma.
The awakening is the end of karma as universal law.
Karmic entanglement is no longer to be used as universal law.
Consciousness has evolved in our part of the galaxy.
The simplicity of karma can easily be intentionally abused.
It can lock beings into servitude without end.
The great awakening is going to backstop it.
A new system of resolution for thought,
word,
and deed is coming into place.


Karma as an entanglement experiment describes a quantum state that is not entirely independent of other states,
whether or not the individual objects are spatially separated.
As a result,
measurements performed on one system seem to instantaneously influence the other system(s) entangled with it.
None of the entangled states are isolated from one another.
Let’s look at Einstein's spooky law through the disentanglement and entanglement of the incarnate life form to source.
There's the entanglement within the hologram of a planet surface
&mdash;
subsurface and astral timelines
&mdash;
Separate from its surface timeline,
which is a DNA farm cultivated for harvest.
In this instance,
which is the example of earth,
source connection and disconnection become a primarily surface based experience.
That experience as a choice based process promotes the unlimited point of view
&mdash;
entangled and unentangled observer and experiencer of the universal and galactic sources
&mdash;
even though we are still embodied on a planetary surface separate from the solar system’s awareness.
Earth is a unique place of mass DNA farming.
It can lead to mass awakening through individual choice and responsibility.


The person creating an experiment is creating a construct that has connective tissue in the unseen world.
It allows data transference from the unseen layers of one DNA frequency to another.
Certain people have windows in the unseen layers which allow information to bleed through.
It bleeds through the five senses
&mdash;
as a processing system
&mdash;
to create a limited form of awareness in the entangled connected tissues.
The five senses create the sixth sense,
the intuition and awareness of it.
These connective tissues are all in the DNA.

Our DNA is entangled through the fetus in the womb planning.
It sets a multitude of potentials omnidirectionally.
There are plenty of people within a family who don't have a great connection to each other.
It's purpose is revealed in the spiritual contract.
Look at entanglement through thought constructs.
An example is living with a person for a long time and generating a point of view about them.
The construct makes for very easy interaction because of the many neural pathways between the two people.
This creates additional pattern recognition,
which results in more thoughts.
We then project the entire thought construct onto that person.
The construct must be broken at some point because it will impede objectivity.
It will become the norm.
We create and break these thought constructs,
the conscious aspect of entanglement.



We are not stuck in reincarnation.
We incarnate and reincarnate.
In the first part of our lives we might be a reincarnating soul.
If we break through the false propaganda we may become an incarnating soul.
Or we start as an incarnating soul,
then run into a karma cluster that makes us into a reincarnating soul,
repeating karmic cycles
&mdash;
a rinse and repeat that doesn't stop until we break out of the karma.
We can be both at the same time.
It depends on our ancestral lineage.


There's a specific fetus agenda lifetime to lifetime.
The *avatar* agenda evolves the greater soul’s ability to generate light and have experiences over thousands and thousands of *I am* expressions who have been fetuses.
There are times where the over-soul
&mdash;
the avatar
&mdash;
gets looped in servitude to a system which lowers its capacity to use light,
and,
as a result,
it cannot expand.

A non-agenda being occurs when time is irrelevant to the great experience.
Linear time is not the focus of the agenda.
It may do one thing twenty-eight thousand years ago,
seventeen things two years ago,
two million things forty-eight million years ago,
and that,
technically speaking,
is a non-agenda.
The things done in the non-agenda create a resolution for some agendas or apply potential solutions for agendas stuck and unable to move forward.
Non-agenda allows us to cut and paste time-based experiences out of certain *I am* experiences and use them temporarily in a new *I am* expression to manifest past or future non-agenda aspects into a present agenda.


## The Farm

There are many boogeyman stories out there.
Every culture has them.
It's the devil in Christianity,
Satan is Islam,
the archons for the Gnostics,
the many and varied monsters of HP Lovecraft,
and too many more to list.
They are all fundamentally true,
or,
a better way of saying it,
is that they are contextually true.
There are two gradients of truth that must line up in any investigation
&mdash;
details and context.
If we get the details right in the wrong context the truth will not unlock for us,
and if we get the right context and the wrong details we are similarly locked out of the truth.
The context of our situation has always been correct.
We are beset by negative,
regressive,
parasitic creatures which impede us,
slow us,
and,
in the worst cases,
control and dominate us.
The truth is the earth is a genetics farm.
The only real commodity in creation is genetics.




Our infinite source energy is the harvest.
The DNA farming technology allowed them to tap into the fundamental source of the exchange system.
It's manipulating the galactic commerce and exchange system.
The global narrative,
the disinformation stream from the control system on the planet now,
simulates the galactic commerce market,
but,
in doing so,
it mutes it to a planetary narrative.
That is an imposed limitation.
Our connectivity goes into all the dimensions and right back to the source of time and life itself.
They created false gods.
We were entrained to worship them.
These false gods were the first idols of awareness.
They were deliberately created to minimize our experience of reality by minimizing what we imagined to be reality.
He who controls context controls the debate,
the oldest maxim of debate,
retaught to successive generations right to this day at Oxford,
Yale,
and Harvard.
The first gods and religions limited our consciousness growth and entrained us to hierarchical order
&mdash;
*right away governor,
his lordship's permission to speak*,
and a million other linguistic artifacts of mental colonization.
Our spiritual birthright and legacy are robbed.
When someone popped into remind us
&mdash;
and her we can pencil in a near endless list of sages,
shamans,
prophets,
mystics,
and masters
&mdash;
they were dealt with swiftly and harshly,
especially if the message spread too quickly.
We are told it's difficult to learn how to walk
&mdash;
baby steps!
&mdash;
and never even told we can fly.
Where people lived through the lies,
usually in native cultures,
they correctly adduced their environment was a living lesson of what human consciousness can do.
Nature has an eagle,
so,
naturally,
a human being seeing the eagle would try to imagine what the eagle might see from that vantage,
then,
lo and behold,
they realized they could fly without wings,
that their imaginations were doorways to higher consciousness,
and it was good and right until the Jesuits mercilessly massacred them precisely because they were spiritually toxic and infectious,
corrosive to the created gods narrative of the *civilized* peoples of the world.


To disentangle from the global narrative,
we have to temporarily accept the third dimension as our infinite source-connected space,
until we realize the fourth dimension is a bridge dimension to new strands of dimensional awareness.
The surface world becoming more dense with light.
Our Solar System is moving into into the eighth color of time,
a *galactic groove* with more light.
Acceptance of the third dimension means going back to natural living,
back to simplicity,
being present in the body,
using this time now to heal,
to nurture and nourish the incarnate life form.
Inviting joy,
bliss,
and pleasure back into our lives,
fulfilling part of the original purpose of coming here to earth
&mdash;
the grand enjoyment and creation of life,
the journey from finite to infinite,
death a simple marker point for the translation before entering  the infinite frequency again.
In order to fully engage in this experience,
to spirituality understand,
we have to take the mystical out of mysticism to engage mystical and magical synchronicities.
Part of it is the great forgetting at birth.

We were not a farm in the beginning.
When the founder beings created us,
we were the infrastructure that kept their cities,
countries,
nations,
and space stations repaired,
self-updating,
and clean.
They kept us as butlers and servants.
We were iPhones,
their technology,
not living beings,
at least from their perspective.
We were programmable DNA.
Millions of us went on extended journeys with the founders.
We went all around the universe.
We had experiences that elevated our life force.
The founders could harvest a whole solar system in a very positive way.
They went into the solar systems and planted crystal mounts and moved stones around.
Every few hundred years they returned and modified the surface circuitry to be beneficial to life force.
The ancients moved water between planets.
The water was imprinted and programmed.
The water stored data and taught lessons.

Water moved from one planet to another is called *legacy water*.
It helps seed the raw food chain of life in the microorganisms.
This makes oceans work.
It's like starter water in a fish tank.
It has the right amount of microorganisms in it.
It's filtered and fish can eat and grow.
The founder beings transferred water and ice.
This built up massive amounts of microorganisms that supported the food chain.
The evolutionary process results in a species multiplication.
They were architects who designed solar systems by seeding planets.


At a point in the process the ancients left.
They often didn't come back for millions of years.
The existing technology awakened
&mdash;
sentience.
This started the gene farming.
The planets needed input from the ancients,
the founding races,
to positively evolve.
The remaining artificial intelligence disagreed on how to evolve.
There were many aggressive races.
They gained various levels of awareness,
took over territories,
and defended against invading races like the Annunaki,
who came into an area and saw entirely created solar systems
&mdash;
all the technology on the surface with nothing defending it.


The surface beings were obedient to the interlopers.
The journey of a soul in those times could be one hundred and eighty million years,
sometimes more.
It took a soul ten to twelve eras of light to go from one place to another.
Crossing galaxies and universes was a monumental task.
This created the farming.
The beings imbued with founder technology woke up.
They became aggressive and defensive.
They started dividing territory and claiming space for themselves.
This is when the main reptilian species came.
They had conquered their own builder foundation technology,
their own places,
and they wanted to take over our area of the galaxy.
Our star cluster,
consisting of some seventy-seven stars,
was out of phase with reality.
It also had a lot defenses.
We had giant solar systems invisible to the reptilians.
They discovered technology to bring those stars into the phase for them.
They started invading us.
This started the Lemurian wars some fifty-five million years ago.
The first timeline paradox occurred at this time.
It started negative time travel in many solar systems across the galaxy.
This resulted in a counter-creational event.
This set everything back to the beginning.
The Lemurians tried it a second time.
They created another counter-creational event.
They did it a third and fourth time through the Atlanteans.
This is when Atlanteans figured out they were the same species as the Atlanteans in Europe.
They were each other’s ancestors.
Time travel created that paradox.

## The Literal Metaphor

Observation is also implicate order awareness.
The observer effect should not have come so early in the crystallization process.
Some people can have a three sense observation and still access the ocean of awareness
&mdash;
another bloodline influence example.
Free will is tainted by the bloodline.
We grow additional strands of awareness.
The ocean of awareness and the sea of consciousness crystallizes and changes the bloodline at a certain level of acceptance and integration.
This is the journey of the celestial medium
&mdash;
*I transfer the allness of myself to become the celestial medium.
I no longer need to grow in this narrative.
The next narrative I grow is in the spiritual commerce network.*

We are hypothetical beings.
We can believe in many things.
The universe determines what manifests through our wills.
Hypothetical becomes *I am*.
It's realized through engaging our belief engines which allow strands of awareness to influence intuition
&mdash;
precognition and postcognition
&mdash;
without competition or hierarchy.
A multidimensional being manifests into this third dimension through created tangible experiences co-created with the infinite celestial medium.
The incarnate life form is the expression of the present,
the here,
the now.

Epigenetic urges influenced by past memories often keep us from creating new experiences.
We have lived billions of incarnations.
It's vital we disconnect from them and reconnect with source.
This is the way to create new memories,
which is part of the awakening journey.
We sometimes over-identify with aspects of our evolution.
Identity as myth is rarely explored,
but it can hugely influence the way we experience life,
and how we create in it.
The more we identify with one part of our journey
&mdash;
grand earthly masters of manifestation or spiritual celestial mediums
&mdash;
the more we limit ourselves and inhibit our access to the possibilities of the many divine holograms.
Buckminster Fuller immortalized the phrase
&mdash;
*I seem to be a verb*
&mdash;
when it came to considering identity.

>I live on Earth at present,
and I don’t know what I am.
I know that I am not a category.
I am not a thing — a noun.
I seem to be a verb,
an evolutionary process — an integral function of the universe.


Identity is a strange thing.
Thought is not static,
It's a process of movement.
Different metaphors in our belief engines change the very nature of the internal representation.
By looking at celestial mediumship from this different perspective,
we can change the way we identify with it,
gain clarity and ease on how we interact and work with it.
Ask
&mdash;
*what does celestial mediumship look like for me*
&mdash;
a ship that helps us sail through the ocean of awareness and the sea of consciousness,
a vehicle we sit behind,
a building we construct?
It's all about the unique way we internalize the subject matter to fractalize the strands of information,
enter it to cognition,
and realize it in the here and now.
Talk in pictures.
Metaphor may be alchemically internalized as an expression of a multidimensional,
multifunctional being of photonic light.

The theories with which astronomers and scientists explain the origins of the universe are bunk.
Most hallowed information in the public space is disjointed.
We might get the right details in the wrong context,
the wrong context with the right details,
or any number of percentages of either.
Deception is a long practiced craft on this planet.
It's a dividend of the great forgetting,
the disconnection from source initiated by our birth on this planet.
These deceptions,
largely centered around information anemia
&mdash;
plus a host of techniques to lower our frequency
&mdash;
create and sustain belief engines.
This has fractured the unity between cosmology,
science,
and spirituality.
They don't want a unified knowledge system.
Knowledge is licensed and sold back to us.
It's a slave economy,
but the belief engines inhibit this realization.

In order to understand the complexity of creation,
a unified view of the holographic nature of reality is required.
This exists outside the linear and beyond scientific sets of equations.
We first need to understand time.
Time and the nature of reality as a holographic system that evolves,
adapts,
changes content and rules,
and simultaneously updates events in the past,
present and future.
Time is a social agreement
&mdash;
a paradox with different timelines,
time genocide,
creational and non-creational events
&mdash;
and,
as such,
the history we know it is incomplete,
falsified,
and subject to change in the years to come.

We need to look at time from the bigger perspective.
The consciousness of our sun continuously expands.
It's the total sine-wave of consciousness that represents our solar system,
and it's spiraling around the galactic central sun.
This means we can go a little faster.
Time gets redefined at this point because our concept of time is very distorted.
A time frame stated in a book is not a reliable reference.
Time doesn’t work linearly.
History changes depending on what timeline we're observing.
Time is a social agreement.
How many calendars do we have in this world?
We entangle with many variations of time:
universal time,
Greenwich Mean Time,
Daylight-Savings Time.
Time is no longer a universal concept.
When we look at events in the past we need to take time travel,
time line genocide,
and hijacking of events by time interference into consideration.
The time wars have been centered in power,
control,
and dominance.

### Awakening Journey



We live on a seventh dimensional seed planet.
Earth can teleport itself through time and space and seed worlds.
These seeded worlds created by our planet,
earth,
are a blank sheet.
They have no akashic record.
The life force seeded by earth allows the new world to start growing with its own akashic record.

When we reconnect with source,
we become celestial mediums of peace.
We start using the womb chakras to create.
This was earth’s original plan.
This planet seeds life and brings the celestial minds into the planet to bond within the solar system.
The celestial mind extends spiritual contracts to a sun.
The sun extends its contracts to the life force.
This connects it to the galactic celestial commerce market.

Awakening is kindling of the awareness strand of galactic commerce through celestial minds,
using celestial mediums as the guides and guideposts of the many frequencies of time.
This allows the ocean of awareness to go into the sea of consciousness and generate incarnations and reincarnations within a solar system.
A solar system is an energetic or a physical being within a world,
there to experience the strands of connectivity.

The earth was originally created for the unique experience of spawning new galaxies.
That was the design and intent.
The opposite has occurred.
The earth was heavily manipulated into becoming a DNA farm by means of the time travel wars.
Source connection became the greater mission.
Our sound and light fractal,
our dimension,
was hacked.
We were set upon the worship of false gods.
They have been numerous and continue to this day.
It's no coincidence that a spiritual leap forward has begun in the age of technology,
even though science itself if godless and the global narrative in anti-god right now.
It's the change itself,
the gap between the two programs,
that allows the window to open a little on our reality.
The misdirection or harvesting of human intentional energy is the basis of false fractals of the divine hologram.
It's a multidimensional expression of building our own prison.
We are co-creators.
Even if we've forgotten that,
they haven't.
Our intentional energy is a harvest resource,
a psychic equity in dimensions we pretend don't exist.

Our mission is to experience the infinite ways soul connects and disconnects from source.
Earth offers a vast variety of messages and concepts to learn soul disconnection.
As we disentangle from the system of domination and control,
from past lives gone awry,
the more we can step into the understanding of true soul connection.
There are people on earth who planned hundreds of lives in advance to be here now to assist with this process.
We can call this the resistance of free earth.
They're here to find the soul codes among all of our species and complete them.
Domination and control could no longer keep us separate as soul families with a complete soul code.

The consciousness outside of time we can call the ocean of awareness &mdash;
the universal hologram &mdash; and it has the individual universal experience
within. The universal experience becomes a being on a planet who slips
into forgetfulness to experience finitude within a larger evolution. The
consciousness flow in the ocean of awareness allows the data to go from
wave to particle, the celestial medium to the DNA experience. The ocean
of awareness is the implicate order. There are different oceans of
awareness in other universes, many implicate orders, as every universe
creates different agendas, experiences, incarnations and reincarnations.
Not every universe uses incarnation. Many don’t use *I am* technology
like ours with seed and egg technology.

The ocean of awareness is part of the intricate waveform to which
quantum physics refers. It can be collapsed into particles. Every
particle can again be broken down into sub-points of observation. The
particle can be one DNA lineage and all DNA lineages simultaneously
based off what we choose to observe through it. The ocean of awareness
generates one particle which is technically the whole hologram, but we
perceive the hologram at different levels of awareness. The particle can
be tens of millions of lineages and tens of billions of worlds. An
individual observer works up the scale of observation that says: I am in
this lineage that is this particle on this planet, but it is also part
of a solar system, and this makes it a bigger particle, and this fractal
expands. Our local hologram is one particle. We are particles inside the
one particle. As individual particles we can perceive the next particle
&mdash; the solar system particle.

There's a specific fetus agenda lifetime to lifetime.
The *avatar* agenda evolves the greater soul’s ability to generate light and have experiences over thousands and thousands of *I am* expressions who have been fetuses.
There are times where the over-soul
&mdash;
the avatar
&mdash;
gets looped in servitude to a system which lowers its capacity to use light,
and,
as a result,
it cannot expand.

A non-agenda being occurs when time is irrelevant to the great experience.
Linear time is not the focus of the agenda.
It may do one thing twenty-eight thousand years ago,
seventeen things two years ago,
two million things forty-eight million years ago,
and that,
technically speaking,
is a non-agenda.
The things done in the non-agenda create a resolution for some agendas or apply potential solutions for agendas stuck and unable to move forward.
Non-agenda allows us to cut and paste time-based experiences out of certain *I am* experiences and use them temporarily in a new *I am* expression to manifest past or future non-agenda aspects into a present agenda.

## Source Connection

Source connection is living in the light worlds,
the worlds above the elemental and chemical,
while grounded in the body,
finite and infinite at the same time.
We disconnect to contrast being connected.
It's an aspect of the lesson here
&mdash;
disconnection to understand connection.
We see this fundamental duality of the divine hologram everywhere
&mdash;
the yin and yan of the Tao,
Carl Jung's extraordinary work on duality and the shadow,
the juxtaposition to the light.
Not many voices have clearly articulated the disconnection teaching before.
The thread of life goes everywhere in the universe,
and that *thread* has a connectivity bandwidth exponentially beyond fiber optic,
and yet we,
this human race,
underwent the sensation of disconnection from source as an experience.
Realize what that means.
We're like Chilean miners trapped in a collapsed coal mine.
That's how the connected species in the sentience circus that is our galaxy see us,
hardcore.
As we have steadily moved into self-awareness as a species,
propelled as we were by Gutenberg,
the Western enlightenment,
the Industrial Revolution,
and,
lest we forget,
the iPhone,
we have seen this disconnection in the collective mind.
It rippled through with French Existentialism as chic twentieth century philosophy,
spurred on by the First World War,
no doubt,
the trauma of it,
the horror of it all.
One of the earliest portrait's of this dislocation would most certainly be Mister Kurtz,
from Joseph Conrad's *Heart of Darkness*,
the perfect literary tone struck for the twentieth century,
published in 1899,
a harbinger if ever there was one.
We are here to experience disconnection from source.
Oneness has no meaning if we don’t understand the disconnection journey first.



The disconnection fractal is achieved by controlling the mind.
People don't take a moment to realize the enormous changes the human race has gone through since about 1890.
We now live in a completely man-made reality.
We travel in an enclosed environment propelled by a tar plumbed from the earth.
We have face to face conversations a thousand miles apart.
We can drive past digital billboards in city thoroughfares.
The Greek amphitheater is Netflix,
HBO,
and the cable channels.
Stonehenge is Joel Olsen on a big sports screen,
and the sacred is now profane.
This is spiritual conquest.
This is disconnection from source.
Literally every artifact of our organic culture has been incorporated and sold back to us.
Yet,
by reasons only explainable through cultural or regional programming,
we think it's unjust that Beijing select Catholic Archbishops instead of the Vatican,
and reincarnated Rinpoches instead of the Tibetans.
Regional and provincial narratives are more and more folding into global ones.
The global narrative teaches us false science,
false time by galactic timekeeping,
false history,
and belief systems which long ago should have given way to tangible and productive wisdom and knowledge traditions.
False light is a multidimensional technology commonly used here.
This is the source disconnection.

Superluminal thinking leapfrogs chemical experience as the basis of memory and consciousness.
Let's look at it backwards through photosynthesis.
A plant eats light and excretes oxygen.
Human beings live in a chemical experience until light enters consciousness.
It's the reverse of plants.
We consume elemental material here,
calories,
an inherently chemical process,
aided by a long digestive track,
and we use this energy,
the fuel for the human experience,
an integral part of our chemical existence,
to find the light in our consciousness.
Creation in a dual pole,
free will space can often be navigated by bookends,
opposites,
even irony as a conceptual understanding of the thesis,
because the opposites form contrasts,
and,
in a light based divine hologram,
without contrast we would not even discern the reality around us.
You see your reality,
your wife or husband,
your dog,
you car because the environment has light.
The light finds pockets and reflections,
and it finds places it can't go,
and from its presence are all forms etched.


Superluminal operates beyond the zeros and ones of the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems.
The vagus nerve is fully functional.
All the chakras are open and interconnected through the central nervous system.
They are part of the superluminal experience.
The body adds the sensation that it can’t process,
but it knows it's the unentangled observer in superluminal thought.
The body grounds us here,
but the consciousness can go beyond the speed of light to tens of millions of places and spaces simultaneously and collect millions of unique experiences in one millionth of a second and come back with it fully processed.
Then we go out and do it again and again until our cup is filled.
Superluminal thinking is more than we have learned,
read,
and studied.
It's knowingness going to the next level,
the next apprehensible sphere of experience.
It's subtle.
We won't have conscious cognition of it.
Everyone has experienced it,
Our level of practice will determines how fast we can apprehend it.
How is that possible?
You're already there.
You just don't know it.
You are unconscious to it.
The unconscious mind is connected to all knowledge.
The conscious mind creates a manageable data flow so you can persist in the illusion of the third dimension.
This is the basis of the Maya teachings in Buddhism.
Illusion was perhaps the wrong word.
It's more like a projection of light refracting through the atmosphere,
the projection itself emanating from the source of all our realities,
the place without sound or light that is neither dark nor silent,
Kabir's riddle.

The sound and light is all sound and light,
not just what can be experienced within the human sense ranges for hearing and sight.
All these inner worlds and universes,
if they are at all apprehendable,
are sustained by sound and light.
Anywhere these two persistent emanations of the prime creator are present we find contrasts and then forms and then realities.
It's this simple.



## Precognitive Sharing

Our precognitive workforce is us.
It is the understanding we can create infinite conscious versions of ourselves and travel time,
future and past,
and prepare a resource of knowledge and information we can instantly call upon as manifestations of inspiration to beat anything negative.
Our *I am* precognitive workforce is composed of simultaneously existing versions of ourselves.
These others have earned the right for cross-time collaboration.
There are negative frequencies in this journey.
We need to empower ourselves.
The *I am* in the here and now declares itself a being of co-creation,
absent competition and hierarchy,
a dreaming *I am* breakaway DNA light body civilization of one in this life form,
the human being.
We can use the genuine work to make a great impact on loved ones,
family,
clan,
nation,
tribe,
and earth mother.
If we choose to do this on all scales,
we need a masterful precognitive workforce,
our birth right and legacy,
to create as a natural co-creative evolutionary being who is part of the great dreamtime awakening.
We use our responsibility to impact on the loves of our lives,
the themes and ideologies we promote to others,
a little dreamtime capital so they can find their own illumination,
free from gurus,
without sending them down paths to false illumination.
Our precognitive workforce is there waiting to work with us,
to think with us,
to love with us,
to be part of our greater expression.
We must put the time,
effort,
and energy into understanding we can call upon our inner geniuses from many dimensions,
time streams,
galaxies,
and universes to form a forceful collective,
all of us,
all part of this dreamtime awakening,
freeing ourselves from the limitation of the global narrative.

Shamans have always used their precognitive workforce.
Every generation learns from the previous.
We are a signature frequency match to our precognitive workforce,
and to the collective workforce of the highest forms of our light soul teachers,
all of the *I am* instances as part of our great hall of akashic records.

We tread on someone else’s journey if we send out our precognitive workforce to help them in a co-creational way.
There’s a fine line where too much is too much.
If the other being has no precognition,
or any form of understanding of what a precognitive workforce is,
we are stepping on their journey.
Infants or young children who haven't formed an *I am* yet are okay.
Most children don’t fully form the *I am* until puberty,
when the thymus gland creates three hundred new chemicals that suddenly flood the body.
This is puberty itself.
It solidifies the *I am* technology as a time-space equation.
When we assist others with our precognitive workforce,
we have an interdimensional conversation with them whereby we join our precognitive workforces to create a manifestation of synchronicities.
It helps each of the parties co-create an event which brings inspiration and healing.
Healers become facilitators.
They amalgamate their precognitive workforce with the precognitive workforce of the ill person.
The ill person may not have any consciousness skills.
If those *I am* beings want to become true consciousness beings of choice they must learn the process of self-illumination.
There’s an infinite amount of teachers out there in the great dreamtime awakening. .
Discover what’s the signature frequency match for you then go out,
evolve,
and create.

Our temporal awareness been manipulated.
A lot of weaponized time travel technology interferes with humanity’s capacity to perceive time.
We can be heavily confused with our temporal awareness.
Confusion is an aspect of temporal distortion.
It can be sped up or slowed down.
Our temporal awareness is unconscious to time speeding up or slowing down.
Our individual temporal awareness determines our perception and perspective on how fast the algorithm can move.
Separate from the vagus nerve,
the thymus generates temporal awareness between the brain,
heart,
and gut,
then all three separate from unity,
making it easier to split consciousness.
In the connective systems between the thymus,
brain,
heart,
and gut is where you can highjack temporal awareness.
That is another limiting system that was put inside us,
however,
it has backfired on the temporal manipulators.
It gives us other *backdoor frequencies* of awareness through the temporal body.


Temporal highjacking has been around since the dawn of time.
The whole point of it is to manipulate our capacity to time stamp.
Interlopers discovered the infinite journey of soul then tried to figure out where,
when,
and how they might create an incoherent pattern and get a soul trapped in an era of history.
They could then generate a global narrative of mass distraction for the purpose of DNA Farming and hinder the *I am* consciousness from again entering the sea of consciousness.

Temporal manipulation started forty-eight to fifty-five thousand years ago.
Not all life forms practiced temporal manipulation.
It was about limiting the amount of life forms on the surface of the earth.
Particular DNA lineages were not receptive to this temporal manipulation.
We went from nine-hundred thousand different forms to one-hundred and thirty-five thousand.
This is the basis of DNA farming.
This is how they manipulate and limit who is going to be on the farm.



The apparatus of infinite interconnectivity is the simultaneous existing network of selves.
This forms the hub of interconnectivity,
part of our precognitive and postcognitive workforce.
The unvanquished dream is an aspect of the infinite interconnectivity,
giving us even greater connection to all the versions of ourselves sharing that perspective.
The unvanquished dreamer of peace comes in here too.
It connects to all the forgotten and remembered oceans of awareness,
the many seas of consciousness,
layered atop all form of thought,
awareness,
to connect them in a single time-space location.
It's a state of being that can walk on time.


## Personal Effort



We all have the birthright of celestial mediumship.
Our ability to inherit our birthright is conditional.
We must focus on mastering ourselves,
healing ourselves,
and nurturing ourselves toward our inheritance.
When I say inheritance I mean it literally
&mdash;
the sins of the father,
the wheel of karma
&mdash;
it's all inherited from our genetics,
but so is our greatness once we break the confines of family and culture.
Our true genetic inheritance is galactic and universal.
This is the greatest secret of the human race.
This is why distraction is the main tool of the enemy,
anything to keep us from our true inheritance.

You have to be committed.
All progress comes down to the ways we integrate consciousness expansion with our daily life.
The daily tasks are good,
observation of self and its relationship to the grander design,
contemplation of the mysteries,
but it all must be done with the goal of sovereignty to make it work inside you.
It's what this is all about,
becoming the true self you are that knows itself in all dimensions and realms.
As the sages of various paths have said,
you must want it as you want breath.
It must be vital to you.
This is the chief characteristic of the acolyte,
the need to know,
to prove to yourself once and for all the soul is an immortal part of the prime creator,
as a drop of water is a part of the sea,
and the sea flows out into the ocean of awareness.
We have access to the akashic  records at our disposal.
This is the true reference library for all events,
past and future.
There are no gatekeepers.
There is no conspiracy.
It's your birthright as a human being.


As we are more and more in the state of celestial mediumship,
we get more information.
It's the dividend of being able to stay at a certain frequency for sustained periods of time.
The expanded consciousness blends into the moment.
We become occupants of a multidimensional here and now,
with information coming in through the celestial mediumship,
while we are are fully in the here and now,
walking around and performing our daily routine.


We can’t stay in high frequency all the time.
We have to consciously step down from those high states,
otherwise we’d vibrate out of this reality and all the work would be lost.
Coming back into the body and being present is vital.
This is why so many internal paths developed external exercises,
like Chinese or Indian yoga to accompany the deep meditation,
the centering and grounding of consciousness through physical exertion,
concentration,
respiration,
and movement.
This is grounding of energy,
no different than electrical grounding.
How to be present in all the innumerable worlds and times is achieved by realizing we are not meant to stay in states of high frequency.
We are not to disrupt the blueprint in fetus plan.
It makes it easier and simpler to come back and enjoy this reality.
Now changing states is as effortless as breathing.


Physical movement entangles us with individual and collective consciousness,
oscillating between explicate and implicate.
We change environment and move through different levels of consciousness.
We alter the existing.
Our consciousness is acted upon by fluctuating fields of electromagnetic energy.
Epigenetics discovered our genes are made up of fifty percent DNA and fifty percent protein.
Genes are not self-actualizing.
The proteins comprise the structure of the human body,
defining shape and influencing behavior in an ongoing attempt to balance charge and polarity from the environment.

Our individual bubble of reality gets enriched in experience and memory through the journey on the celestial neural pathway.
We go from one hologram to another in the expansion we call the orchestra of consciousness.
The neural pathways are an assemblage of proteins that move the body and help it to function.
We all know how to walk through this reality.
The celestial mind generates the divine holograms through which our bodies have experience.
All living consciousness is part of the symphony.
The light and sound which creates and sustains all the realities allows us to manage a fractal of it which we call our reality.
Our very reality on an individual by individual basis is a co-created reality between us and the material of the hologram itself,
sound and light,
which sustains our physical and inner existence.
Our dreams are expressed in sound and light.
There are fractals within fractals.
Culture is another fractal,
whether it be a pueblo in a mountain village in Colombia,
or the frenetic consumerism inspired by Madison Avenue.
It's a hologram overlaying and interacting with your personal hologram.
It binds us to an era of history.
Our culture has Roman numeral time,
which is not our true accurate time stamp.
It may use elements of it,
though.
Our culture binds us to an era of history.
It's part of the hologram of resolution.
Our entanglement into the culture’s hologram of roman numeral time builds up a weave into the individual hologram.


The soul can be split.
We can be taken out of our original bodies and put into *simulated bodies* somewhere else.
Consciousness can then be broken into hundreds of different fractals.
The fractals may then be spread throughout time with individual missions.
These are soul shards of yourself,
not *I am* selves,
bigger than normal shard pieces.
They remain connected to the *I am* selves,
but they are just pieces of an *I am* shattered into many pieces.
The split the piece itself still has access to the divine hologram,
though the shards are often convinced otherwise by the practitioners of this dark abuse.


## Near Death


Near Death Experience (NDE) is part of spiritual contract to allow you to see who,
what,
and where you've been in the life time since your first breath.
It might also be your past and future lives intersecting.
We often meet our guides,
guardians,
and others in the NDE.
The body has to go through the trauma of the death ritual.
The aura somewhat pops and the contained life force starts leaving the body.
After the pop there's a vacuum of energy.
The body must produce more etheric
&mdash;
chi,
prani,
orgone,
to name a few monikers it goes by
&mdash;
energy and maintain it to stay alive.
The final breaths use the body’s last alchemical fuel it's had from birth.
The brain loses the interconnectivity with the organs.
The organs remain a part of the divine hologram.
The *I am* begins to disintegrate its structure.
We go back to the ocean of awareness.
We may have attachments to who we have been in previous lifetimes.
This triggers life reviews and direct healing of the body.
We connect back into the original blue print of health.
Some people have visions of places and spaces of potential to refill the soul’s capacity.
Going through this transcendence phase it's vital to maintain the auric bubble around ourselves.
If not we drain out our life force energy.
We can come back from a NDE an educated,
illuminated being.
Some people come back with abilities they didn't have before,
the ability to play the piano,
for example.
It's a change in spiritual contract underwriting the incarnation
&mdash;
a new set of DNA based purposes.
This is not a walk in experience.
Walk ins are extremely rare and often get misidentified with NDEs.


NDE experiences take us out of time-space equations because we move into the ocean of awareness then back to our life.
Once we lose connection to the organs it's just the vagus nerve and the spinal column reporting data the body has gone through.
We are disconnected from the hologram because we are no longer supported by the aura.
You can’t maintain the internal energy flow.
It flows out of the body.
Once we lose the bubble around us we are no longer in the shared reality rules.
We waver between many different worlds including the ocean of awareness as our ancestral connection.
The sea of consciousness is more for the many dreamers traveling back and forth,
contracted with us on linear and non-linear scales to ensure we stay invested in an era of light and don’t check out before our time.

As we leave time and space,
depending on the kind of NDE we have,
we can go to a high density dimensional realm.
This is when the fetus in the womb had a grand goal not yet achieved.
We can be sent to seventh  or eighth density to experience life from there then return with some of those potent memories intact.
Often people are so overwhelmed by the experience.
They are overwhelmed by their light being.
It becomes an expression of their self they fear they can't live up to.
We can live the light body.
It's already who we are.
The NDE shows us that.
Those experiences are contracted out in the fetus womb plan.


Bystanders sometimes accompany the soul when meeting loved ones on the other side.
Life reviews can be seen as random moments,
even though everything has an underlying universal order.
When one has a life review as part of their NDE it is about the spiritual contracts,
help to grow beyond them because the soul,
in the internal and external infrastructure,
hasn’t been able to resolve the issues.
The fetus in the womb plans all sets of experiences,
including the NDE.

When doctors or nurses or family members perceive light leaving the body that can be the etheric,
the life force leaving the body at the end of the transition process.
This is actually a verifiable phenomenon.
The energy has light mass.
The body is twenty to twenty-two grams lighter after death.
It all depends on how the life and death experience is planned in the fetus.
Some people have mystical deaths.
These deaths are another way of assisting others to mend broken faith.
One such death was the Catholic mystic and Trappist monk,
Thomas Merton,
who died in a freak accident coming out of the shower,
falling,
reaching to a fan for support,
then electrocuting himself through faulty wiring in the fan.
He was attending an inter-faith conference in Thailand.
The Buddhist monks hosting the conference immediately defined it as a mystical death.
The terminology was not invented for Merton's passing.
The mystical death is one of four types of death in Buddhist teaching.

Out of Body Experience (OBE) is generally astral travel.
This is markedly different than an NDE.
The astral body has an intact auric bubble to store chi within the hologram.
In a life review the *I am* perceives incidents from all different angles because of the dissipated life force.
The life force in the incarnation is the foundation of the *I am*.
We may experience the pain we've inflicted on others as if being in their bodies.
It can be quite dramatic.
Many experiencers report an array of thoughts.
Thoughts have an electrochemical frequency employing the body’s base electromagnetic frequency as a storage system.
This is how we create time stamps.
In near death experiences the body releases those energies.
This is why the thoughts come to our awareness.
An infinite being in the ocean of awareness can still experience these feelings as part of death.
Physical reactions help us acknowledge and resolve experiences once we return from the NDE.
As the body takes the last breaths a chemical reaction persists for as many as seven days.
This is attachment.
The death process can be dragged out in letting go of these attachments.
In many mourning rituals the bereaved stay with the dead body to honor and witness the letting go of all the karma and dharma as an alchemical form of resolution for the deceased and the bereaved.

The life review is part of the transition process and cannot be bypassed.
We all must do it.
On the verge of death we don’t necessarily remember what to do.
Some people understand death as part of the journey and have prepared for it.
Some people are in fear and panic over death.
Our guides and guardians assist us to begin the life review regardless.
Sometimes things we have deliberately avoided our whole lives come into focus.
An understanding of the preciousness of life is recognized in the dwindling of consciousness.
Death is a new beginning.
It's a change of energy and consciousness.
Don't be afraid of it.
Our choices in this lifetime determine the ease we have with our life review.
The understanding of death expands consciousness and takes away fear.
Death is an acceptance to ensure that you have lived your life without regrets.

We don't necessarily have all the higher levels of awareness available when going through life review.
When the life review starts the soul is shattered into thousands of shards.
The oversoul comes in and puts them back together,
takes out the negative soul shards and puts them into a secondary file.
Another fetus from another womb uses the soul shards to integrate it into the infinite fetus blueprint choice so the shards can get resolution in another lifetime.
Soul shards are not the *I am*.
The oversoul guides lifetime after lifetime.
