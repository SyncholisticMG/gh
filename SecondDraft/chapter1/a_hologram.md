### Hologram

Our reality here on earth is a hologram.
A hologram is defined as follows by *Merriam Webster's Online Dictionary*:


> a three-dimensional image reproduced from a pattern of interference produced by a split coherent beam of radiation (such as a laser) also : the pattern of interference itself


It's a bit wordy,
but dictionaries have to be that way.
Their our language base along with grammar.
We get the nouns right then apply actions in time.
This book was written in English.
The English language has twelve verb tenses,
twelve expressions of time in which an action,
the verb in the grammar model,
can be applied to an object,
the object in the grammar model,
by a subject,
the subject in the grammar model.

The twelve verb tenses are:
present simple,
present continuous,
present perfect,
present perfect continuous,
past simple,
past continuous,
past perfect,
past perfect continuous,
future simple,
future perfect,
future continuous,
future perfect continuous.
Most people do not know the verb tenses by name,
yet they use them on a daily basis.
Grammar is a map of time.

Space-time is an infinite set of co-ordinates atop existence.
Existence itself goes beyond time.
We can therefore say that time is a temporary condition.
A bit ironic,
but we understand that time is only the measurement of things that come and go in the hologram of the earth.
A hologram as defined by this manuscript is a three dimensional sound and light projection.
Everything around us is part of the hologram
&mdash;
the street on which we live,
our mother and father,
our pets,
everything.

The holographic reality has been explored extensively by other researchers and writers,
most notably in *The Holographic Universe: The Revolutionary Theory of Reality* by Michael Talbot.
It's an excellent read.
The pullout quote from *The New York Times* review sums it up perfectly.

> In The Holographic Universe, Michael Talbot argues nothing less than that the universe is itself one giant hologram. Mr. Talbot thus explains out-of-body experiences, quantum-theory problems, the paranormal, and other unsolved riddles of brain and body.



The concept of a hologram is daunting for people.
It strikes at the very concept of reality.
If this is a hologram then what's real?
The answer is a paradox.
Our reality is simultaneously real and unreal.
It depends on us.
It's not surprising the hologram is trending now as a social concept.
It's everywhere.
Talbot seems to be at the forefront of it.
His tome was published in 1991.
By the end of the nineties it was everywhere.
We call it the matrix now,
thanks to a couple brothers,
the Wachowskis,
who are now sisters,
the result of gender reassignment,
which they both elected to undergo.

The Wachowskis wrote and directed *The Matrix*,
the phenomenally successful 1997 film,
starring Keanu Reeves.
Talbot may be the first secular source to address the topic of a projected reality,
but the Wachowskis have owned it since their cinematic trilogy.
The Wachowskis inspired an entire sub-genre of scientific and conspiratorial inquiry,
with everyone wondering
&mdash;
*do we really live in a matrix?*
Merriam Webster defines matrix in multiple ways,
due to the various ways in which the word is used and the various fields of science that employ it,
but the primary definition is as follows.

>something within or from which something else originates, develops, or takes form


The idea that our earthbound reality is a matrix has been around for millennia.
A synonym is Maya from the Buddhist and Hindu teachings.
The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language defines it as follows.


> In Hinduism, Buddhism, and certain other East Asian religions, the transitory, manifold appearance of the sensible world, which obscures the undifferentiated spiritual reality from which it originates; the illusory appearance of the sensible world.
> The power of a god or demon to transform a concept into an element of the sensible world.
> In Hindu mythology: Illusion or deceptive appearance.


When the Buddhists and the Hindus use the word Maya they mean illusion.
The world we perceive through our senses is a complete and total illusion.
It doesn't make sense,
though,
does it?
We eat and the food is real,
tangible,
tactile,
and flavored.
We don't drive an imaginary car to the hardware store.
Try telling your creditors you've deemed your mortgage payments an illusion.
See how long your retain your home.
We are confronted with the real and the unreal at the same time.
It's a paradox,
which is something that is both real and unreal at the same time,
a cohesive contradiction.

It's important then that we be clear in our text what is meant by hologram.
It's the assertion of this text that reality is a projection from another dimension or dimensions.
The projection from the other dimensions produces the relatively consistent rule set which provides the appearance of a reality,
but it's paper thin.
The rule set is broken all the time,
but nobody is broadcasting it,
so we don't hear about it.
The rule set is broken in scientific communities,
mystical communities,
magical communities,
native communities,
and many more.
What happens when we break the rule set?
Like the ring keeper in Tolkien's *Lord of the Rings*,
we keep it secret,
we keep it safe.
Those we tell are spoken to in whisper,
as if evidence of our own uncertainty,
a footnote to our grappling with the paradox.

Most mystery schools,
secret societies,
brotherhoods,
magical and ritual communities exist in some version of this *secret*.
Why?
Do they not want to let the world know?
It's a combination of factors,
but,
chief among them,
is the understanding that without the ability to take the person you're telling the *secret* to out of the rule set as well,
they are not going to believe it.
This is the hologram we live within,
a breakable rule set enforced as absolute by those who have not broken the rule set.
