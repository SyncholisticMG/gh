### Global Narrative

The global narrative is the agreed upon reality.
Some spiritual paths call it social consciousness.
Human beings have a tremendous need for social interaction.
We are social beings.
We have families,
communities,
nations,
religions,
and a host of other binding agents.
We go from one to many,
and when we do our thinking changes.
We conform,
do we not?
Think of high school.
Remember how important every detail of our appearance was.
Remember how easy it was for predatory companies to market against that fear of being outside,
to sell us denim pants,
but not just any denim.
They had to be the exact style that was in fashion,
and so it went for everything
&mdash;
hair,
teeth,
shoes,
and friends.
All of our worth was in the group.
There are sub-narratives for race,
gender,
earning income,
and just about anything else we can think of.
The need to belong never goes away.

There is a deeper meaning to global narrative,
to social consciousness,
a far more sinister meaning.
The global narrative is the boundary of what we can accept as reality.
This is maintained by religious leaders,
science,
government,
medicine,
academe,
and just about anything else that is institutional.
This is the true control narrative.
When someone comes along and they speak outside this global narrative they get censured at first.
If that doesn't work they lose their job.
If what they're saying is self-supporting,
meaning it can provide the income lost upon job termination,
then the discordant human being is at risk of death or extreme censure like incarceration.

Galileo is a classic example.
He presented his astronomy to the world.
It contradicted the Vatican,
even at a time when Copernicus was openly discussed,
and,
contrary to contemporary belief,
the Catholic Church had commenced a vigorous support campaign for science some years earlier,
but,
nonetheless,
something about Galileo conflicted much more severely with the church.
Perhaps it was just the time,
the age.
The church had reached its peak of corruption at the time of Galileo.

The point here is that the global narrative,
the control narrative,
is maintained by the dominant institutions of the day.
These institutions did not evolve naturally.
There are unknown directors and producers crafting the actors in the institutions.
This is not to say there are not people in the institutions who are true believers.
There are,
however,
at the top there is commiseration with the unknown directors and producers.
It was true at the time of Galileo,
and it is true today.

The contemporary global narrative began three hundred years ago,
at the dawn of industrialization.
It occurred when electricity and engines were incorporated by a society not grounded in electricity.
Science had to adapt concepts to fit the circumstance,
and religion and spirituality had to adapt to the new reality.
Electromagnetism had been known about for some time within hermetic orders of alchemists,
essentially secret societies of their time.
It was the beginning of a society that would build around internal combustion engines started by electricity.
This moved to power plants,
electrical grid work across the planet,
and the reorganization of the various belief systems around this.
It was a rapid change after centuries of relative consistency,
and it's been this way ever since,
rapid change.
On the consciousness level we went from semi-literacy in the multidimensional reality to a closed rational objectivity.
The new norm was if you can't prove it then it's not real.
In some ways this was good.
It cleaned out a lot of stale spirituality and superstition,
but it was a classic baby with the bathwater situation.
Premodern societies,
which included the recently discovered *new world* of America and its native population.
The native population was slated for destruction.
The actors in Europe,
the Pope,
the monarchies,
and some of the secret societies knew the native population was in America.
They were a bad example of autonomy and freedom that had to be destroyed.
The long term plan had already been formed.

They needed to get people into cities as slave labor for industrial production lines.
The slaves created and empowered the collective belief system.
People lived in their own bubbles of reality prior to this urban amalgamation.
They had space.
Communities lived a few hundred kilometers apart.
They had their own unique narratives maintained by the chief,
sheriff,
or community council.
Secret societies proliferated so people could have their own narrative among followers and believers.
The writers of the global narrative understood they needed to inspire awe,
and they knew they could do it with trains,
automobiles,
electricity,
indoor plumbing,
hot and cold water,
refrigeration,
and telephones.
By the nineteen twenties people were living in wooden,
stone,
or brick houses that needed heating.
In a century and a quarter electricity was in homes.
People no longer needed whale fat for candles and oil.
Understand how monumental this was
&mdash;
ninety percent of the world was lit by whale fat for millennia.
The narrative had to be updated,
revised,
and maintained from one generation to the next to suppress anything that wasn’t fitting into the official story.
This touches almost every science,
but,
by way of example,
let's use anthropology and the hiding of giant’s skulls and bones.
Yes,
giants were on the earth.
The enforcement of the lies has been an ongoing control policy right up till today.
We have been led to this bottleneck,
this opportunity.
