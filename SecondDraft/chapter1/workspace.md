### Global Narrative

The global narrative is the agreed upon reality.
Some spiritual paths call it social consciousness.
Human beings have a tremendous need for social interaction.
We are social beings.
We have families,
communities,
nations,
religions,
and a host of other binding agents.
We go from one to many,
and when we do our thinking changes.
We conform,
do we not?
Think of high school.
Remember how important every detail of our appearance was.
Remember how easy it was for predatory companies to market against that fear of being outside,
to sell us denim pants,
but not just any denim.
They had to be the exact style that was in fashion,
and so it went for everything
&mdash;
hair,
teeth,
shoes,
and friends.
All of our worth was in the group.
There are sub-narratives for race,
gender,
earning income,
and just about anything else we can think of.
The need to belong never goes away.

There is a deeper meaning to global narrative,
to social consciousness,
a far more sinister meaning.
The global narrative is the boundary of what we can accept as reality.
This is maintained by religious leaders,
science,
government,
medicine,
academe,
and just about anything else that is institutional.
This is the true control narrative.
When someone comes along and they speak outside this global narrative they get censured at first.
If that doesn't work they lose their job.
If what they're saying is self-supporting,
meaning it can provide the income lost upon job termination,
then the discordant human being is at risk of death or extreme censure like incarceration.

Galileo is a classic example.
He presented his astronomy to the world.
It contradicted the Vatican,
even at a time when Copernicus was openly discussed,
and,
contrary to contemporary belief,
the Catholic Church had commenced a vigorous support campaign for science some years earlier,
but,
nonetheless,
something about Galileo conflicted much more severely with the church.
Perhaps it was just the time,
the age.
The church had reached its peak of corruption at the time of Galileo.

The point here is that the global narrative,
the control narrative,
is maintained by the dominant institutions of the day. 




as we know it today was created at the dawn of
industrialization 300 years ago.
It was created so electromagnetic
belief engines could override faith and become a programmed norm. They
needed to get people into cities as slave labor for industrial
production lines. The slaves created and empowered the collective belief
system. People lived in their own bubbles of reality prior to this urban
amalgamation. They had space, and they lived a few hundred kilometers
apart and had their own unique narrative maintained by the chief,
sheriff, or community council. Secret societies proliferated so people
could have their own narrative among followers and believers. The
writers of the global narrative understood they needed to inspire awe,
and they knew they could do it with trains, automobiles, electricity,
indoor plumbing, hot and cold water, refrigeration, telephones. By the
twenties people were living in wooden, stone, or brick houses that
needed heating. In a century and a quarter electricity was in homes.
People no longer needed whale fat for candles and oil. Understand how
monumental this was &mdash; ninety percent of the world was lit by whale fat
for millennia. The narrative had to be updated, revised, and maintained
from one generation to the next to suppress anything that wasn’t fitting
into the official story. This touches almost every science, but, by way
of example let's use anthropology and the hiding of giant’s skulls and
bones. Yes, giants were on the earth. The enforcement of the lies has
been an ongoing control policy right up till today.
