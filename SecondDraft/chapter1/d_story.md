### Story


We live in a reality defined by experience. We tell stories. They have a beginning, a middle, and an end. We chronicle our stories. The first person who ever took pen to paper did so in fear, and this is why human beings are enmeshed in stories. We love the drama. We love to create it, and we love to consume it. Drama is tension. Human beings say they want peace, but it's kind of a scam when you're honest. If we wanted peace we wouldn't create tension in our lives, but without the tension we can't live the drama. It's best just to be honest. If you lie about it you're more susceptible to programming, which proliferates the world, hundreds of broadcast networks and movie studios all over the world &mdash; Hollywood, Bollywood, Hong Kong, Shanghai, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, British Broadcasting Corporation, and too many more to list &mdash; all servicing humanity's insatiable appetite for programming, which is drama for the most part, which, as we have clearly established, is tension. Yet, if you walk up to any human being and ask them if they prefer peace to tension they will tell you they prefer peace. Isn't that strange?

It really isn't that strange when you understand what's going on down
here. On the spiral ladder of our deoxyribonucleic acid &mdash; DNA by its
affectionate abbreviation &mdash; we hold an evolving marker of our place in
time-space which also represents our level of consciousness. This marker
is the sum of our *experience* &mdash; where experience is movement in
time-space, and the drama, the tension, we create &mdash; and represents but a
faction of our greater soul, and the experiences we have assimilated as
a soul faction.

This marker is directly aligned with our level of responsibility because
our level of consciousness is always equal to our level of
responsibility. They are in a symbiotic relationship, consciousness and
responsibility. DNA is in essence coordinates to where we fit in
space-time, or, to stay with our narrative, how we've been *written
into* the story. Our circumstance is our DNA, which is our story, which
is our tension, which is our drama, which we wrote and act out
ourselves, forgetting the author sleeps in our unconscious.

We have the story, creation, and we have the author, God and soul as a
fractal of God, or the prime creator, as God is so anthropomorphically
programmed into human consciousness as a being like us &mdash; two arms and
legs, two eyes and ears, bipedal, and fond of long white beards &mdash; and we
have the actor, soul as well, incarnate &mdash; sheathed really &mdash; in this
body, borrowed from air, earth, water, fire, and ether.

The travail of the soul is to unlock levels of consciousness. It is a
travail because we must suffer for it. New consciousness permits us to
embody new experiences, to write, direct, and star in a more expanded
story.




We are not actuality creating anything in time. We are traversing it and
enjoining an experience with it. We are seedlings in a cosmic garden,
passing through experiences expressed in a specific form of life, and
then, when sentience is achieved alongside language and culture, we go
through any number of human expressions until we master the tool, the
*hu man* form, a rather extraordinary instrument, as maligned as it has
become in the *First World*, the newer, better *hu man* that seems just
around the corner, the *trans hu man*, the super man made from man,
Nietzsche's bastard let loose upon the world &mdash; nonetheless, a rather
extraordinary instrument, the *hu man* form. We are inside a sound and
light reality, one of many, and we traverse and enjoin experience with
it, unaware we're inside it, until, by epiphany, the nature of the
system reveals itself in form. The story was written before we lived it,
even though it seemed like it was really happening for the longest of
times. We are living the mapped out keys of the experiences. Every
choice, path, and set of functions, every different type of life has
been made available to us so we can embody the experience, mapped like a
script, written into what we perceive to be a timeline, a bloodline, a
clan, a tribe, a culture, a people, a place, a planet &mdash; stories within
stories, managed by cosmic editors and keepers of time, all under a
prime creator, an amorphous but fully conscious presence in everything
we call life, unconditionally offering the experiences as an expression
of its love. You believe as much already if you follow a prophetic
religion. The prophets tell of a a story already written.

Do not diminish our position as a living and sentient being. You are
creating within this world. Our free will choices unfold the story. As
the story unfolds, you receive the blessings of the particular
experience. Never feel overwhelmed or helpless. We are truly connected
to the outcome of our unique choices. As we get further into this
journey, we realize we're time traveling beings by nature. In no way is
this experience linear. We are responsible for our creations forwards
and backwards in time, and we can make alterations as we see fit &mdash; when
our consciousness is so unfolded &mdash; by connecting to past and future
versions of ourselves.

Eternity is in the present moment, mediated through attention and
awareness, by perception and perspective, until we leave the celestial
sphere, then, a new swath of perception opens. The outer frequency of
this hologram unfolds into more and bigger holograms. This goes all the
way up the scale of our awareness. Our perception allows us a greater,
360 Â° view. Suddenly perspective has no direction, no horizon, no fade
to black. It's everywhere, operating at a higher law of nature, but
natural nonetheless. We are unentangled.
