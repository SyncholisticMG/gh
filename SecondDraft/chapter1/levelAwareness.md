## The Levels of Awareness


The consciousness outside of time we can call the ocean of awareness &mdash;
the universal hologram &mdash; and it has the individual universal experience
within. The universal experience becomes a being on a planet who slips
into forgetfulness to experience finitude within a larger evolution. The
consciousness flow in the ocean of awareness allows the data to go from
wave to particle, the celestial medium to the DNA experience. The ocean
of awareness is the implicate order. There are different oceans of
awareness in other universes, many implicate orders, as every universe
creates different agendas, experiences, incarnations and reincarnations.
Not every universe uses incarnation. Many donâ€™t use *I am* technology
like ours with seed and egg technology.

The ocean of awareness is part of the intricate waveform to which
quantum physics refers. It can be collapsed into particles. Every
particle can again be broken down into sub-points of observation. The
particle can be one DNA lineage and all DNA lineages simultaneously
based off what we choose to observe through it. The ocean of awareness
generates one particle which is technically the whole hologram, but we
perceive the hologram at different levels of awareness. The particle can
be tens of millions of lineages and tens of billions of worlds. An
individual observer works up the scale of observation that says: I am in
this lineage that is this particle on this planet, but it is also part
of a solar system, and this makes it a bigger particle, and this fractal
expands. Our local hologram is one particle. We are particles inside the
one particle. As individual particles we can perceive the next particle
&mdash; the solar system particle.
